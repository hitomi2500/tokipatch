I agree. Let's go inside.
Go to the video game corner. Go to the Quincy medal game corner.
I don't come to places like this very often...
A lot of girls have been coming here lately. Quincy isn't outdated. Will Quincy go bad?
I see. I always thought it was a boys' playground. Quincy I don't think that's a very good way of saying it. Quincy I don't think so.
What kind of games are you interested in?
I think the puzzles are interesting. It's a Quincy shooter. How about a Quincy crane game?
If it's a game like this, can I do it too...? Quincy I don't think I can do this. Quincy Sounds interesting, but it looks very difficult.
This kind of game is pretty fun.
It's kind of like a casino. Aren't you a Quincy gambler? QuincyIt's pretty popular with girls.
Do I have a knack for gambling? Quincy I don't think so. QuincyThat's right. I didn't know
Wow, a lot of coins came out. What should I do.
amazing. Aren't you a genius? Isn't the Quincy machine broken? Quincy, give me some.
eh? I don't really know how it came out. QuincyIt's a coincidence. I don't bend down that much. Quincy is fine. Is this enough?

It can not be helped. are you going home
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
how was my song
You were good at it. like a pro Quincy not good at all, why don't you start over from the basics? Quincy isn't that good.
I'm glad. I didn't expect you to praise me so much. Quincy Was it that bad? I'm going to lose my confidence... Thank you Quincy. See, it started next time.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What shall we sing next? Do you have any requests?
Any Shiori song will do. Quincy How about a bitter enka ballad here? Quincy What's the new song for Shuran 9?
Thank you. I'm glad. But what should I sing... Do you like Quincy Enka? But I know very little. Quincy I love this song, but I can't sing it yet.
It's nice to talk in a place like this.

Casually ask about hobbies. Quincy subtly explore your favorite places.

Once in a while, it's nice to relax in a place like this.

Ah, it already smells like spring.
It's the season to fall asleep.
By the way, it's hot today.
I agree. It's so hot.
Soon, the sunshine has softened.
Really, It's easier to spend.
It already feels like autumn.
It's the season for delicious food.
Even so, it's cold today.
It's really cold.
I learned that my hobby is listening to music.
I learned that my favorite music is classical music.
I learned that my favorite movies are love stories such as love romances.

I found out that there is a CD of the music I'm looking for now.
I heard that you are collecting accessories now.
I heard that you are collecting hair bands now.

Right now, there seems to be a boy who is interested in him.
Ah, it's show time. Let's go inside early.
I agree. Let's go in early.
It's empty over there. Let's sit down.
"With today's screening, we will conclude today's screening.
Did you enjoy today's movie? QuincyThat movie was boring, wasn't it? QuincyThe movie was okay, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was a lot of fun. I love this kind of thing. Quincy Right? I thought it was funny, but... Quincy I think it was funny. I hope you like it too.
I like love romance more than this kind of thing. QuincyThat's right. I like love romances, but... Quincy I think I like it I like romance, but...
I don't think so, but... I don't hate it. QuincyIs that so? I think a love romance would be better. QuincyYes. I think so too.
Oh, it looks like they're doing a parade.
Come to think of it, there should be a parade today.
Invite them to watch the parade. Quincy pretends not to know and goes home.
Nice. To see a parade like this...
No matter how many times I see it, it's a wonderful parade.
I'm glad you seemed to like it.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What do you think of this swimsuit?
That swimsuit is cute. Quincy doesn't look good. Quincy, that bathing suit is sexy.
Thank you. But it's a little embarrassing. Quincy is a little shocked... QuincyI don't think so, but it's a little embarrassing when you say that...
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
how about swimming
If you want to swim, leave it to me. Quincy can't swim very well... Quincy is about average.
For real? Compared to the old days, It's going to be nice... QuincyYes…. It's just like the old days. Quincy Well then, let's do special training so that we can swim better.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Wow, beautiful. It's pretty empty. Let's sit down early.
Stars are romantic.
It's a glow from hundreds of millions of years ago. Quincy It's just a light. QuincyYes, it was beautiful.
It's so mysterious... I want to look at the stars like this forever. QuincyThat's true, but... It's boring... Don't you think there is a mysterious beauty in the Quincy starry sky?
It's a glow from hundreds of millions of years ago. Quincy It's just a light. QuincyYes, it was beautiful.
It's so mysterious... I want to look at the stars like this forever. QuincyThat's true, but... It's boring... Don't you think there is a mysterious beauty in the Quincy starry sky?
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Wow, beautiful. It's pretty empty. Let's sit down early.
Oh, what constellation is that?
That's Kotoza. Don't explain it with a Quincy tape. Quincy What is that... what is it?
Huh, that's what it is. If I'm not mistaken, it's the constellation of the Orihime star. Quincy It's okay if you don't answer in such a sloppy way. Is there a constellation called Quincy? Maybe they can explain it to you on tape.
I think that's Cygnus. Don't explain it with a Quincy tape. Quincy What is that... what is it?
I don't think it's Cygnus. If you're a Cygnus, you know it. Quincy It's okay if you don't answer in such a sloppy way. Is there a constellation called Quincy? Maybe they can explain it to you on tape.
Let's go home together, Pantagruelle.
Let's go home then. Pantagruelle.
Let's go home then. Pantagruelle.
Well then, goodbye...
Then I'll change my clothes.

I picked up some seashells. I'll give you. Quincy I'll give you the crown I found there. I'm looking for Quincy seashells.
Wow, what a beautiful shell. Thank you. Take care. Quincy Huh? Eh, I'll refrain from doing that. QuincyYes. I hope you find something beautiful.
Then I'll change my clothes.
Shiori is sleeping comfortably.
Put the juice on your cheek. Graffiti on the Quincy Sunscreen! Quincy, let's just leave it alone.
Come on! Oh, I was surprised. Don't threaten me. Quincy, what are you doing? Not terrible. Quincy Ah, I…. You were asleep
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
There are many beautiful flowers.
When I look at flowers, my heart softens. I wonder if I can eat Quincy. Quincy is a beautiful flower.
I don't think so either... Flowers are strange, aren't they? Quincy, do you always think like that? Quincy You would think so. I thought you would say that.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
This flower is so beautiful.
The beauty of nature is wonderful. Shall we take Quincy home? Quincy That's true.
A mysterious beauty that can only be created by nature. I think you should quit Quincy, but... QuincyDo you really think so?
So where shall we go shopping?
Let's go see clothes. Let's go see some Quincy accessories. Let's go to the Quincy junk shop.
Let's go then. Quincy, let's go. Quincy Ja, a junkie? It's fine, but...
Can I have a look...?
Oh, I hope you'll come see me slowly.
I'll see you in a bit.
Oh, I hope you'll come see me slowly.
Can I have a look?
Oh, I hope you'll come see me slowly.
・ ・ ・
sorry. There are so many things I want to see...
It's okay to take your time and watch. Think about what Quincy is waiting for. Quincy Are you satisfied yet?
Thank you. I've seen enough... Dear Quincy, I'm sorry. But even if you don't say it that way... QuincyYeah, thanks. alright, let's go.
I just bought a lot.
I'll bring it Quincy, don't buy this much. QuincySeriously, I bought a lot.
Eh, that's right. Because it's bad... It's not like I'm bothering Quincy. I would be happy if you could bring me some Quincy...
It's okay, it's okay
Well then, can I have it...
Hey, isn't this cute?
Yeah, it suits Shiori well. Quincy I don't think so. Quincy is pretty cute too.
Thank you. I'm so happy... Quincy Right? I thought it was cute, but... QuincyThat's cute too. But I like this one better.
Hey, which necklace do you think suits me?
How about this colorful one? Quincy How about this bullet? Quincy How about this koala?
Was good. This is my hobby too. Does Quincy really suit me? Quincy is cute, but maybe a little childish.
Hey, aren't you scared of something?
That's right, shall we go home now? QuincyIt's cool with a cyber vibe. Quincy It's okay. It's not dangerous.
Was good. I was scared and a little nervous... Quincy doesn't seem to have much of a taste. Quincy Well, if you say so. Believe me, but...
Every time I come here, it's a wonderful place.
sorry. It'll be over soon. Quincy Shall we go to a bigger place? I think I'm used to Quincy.
Oh, I don't mind. don't worry about me Quincy Huh? Right on…. Stay away from it... QuincyI guess... I will never get used to it.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Can you ski well?
Leave the skating to me. Quincy It's a little cowardly on ice, isn't it? Quincy, for now.
Was good. There's something I want you to tell me. QuincyYes. I can't slip... Quincy Well then, let's train more so that we can skate better.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The ice melts and it's a mess.
I have to be careful not to fall. Even if Quincy falls, it's not my fault. Quincy I hope you don't fall.
Yes. I really need to be careful. Quincy I don't think so. Quincy I know that, but...
Then let's slide quickly.
Let's do so.
How good are you at skiing?
If you want to ski, leave it to me. Quincy sleds have confidence though. Quincy I can skate for now.
Then let's go to the advanced course together. Quincy It can't be helped, so it's a beginner's course. Quincy Well, it's an intermediate course.
Then let's slide quickly.
Let's do so.
By the way, what do you think? this ski wear.
It fits well and is cute. Quincy doesn't suit me at all. Like a Quincy pro skier.
Thank you. I'm so happy. Quincy himself liked it, but... Just Quincy parentheses. But I'm kind of happy.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Which do you prefer, watching baseball or actually playing it?
I'd rather play it for real. Because I hate Quincy baseball. I think you should watch Quincy.
After all, boys do. If you're Quincy, why bother coming to see baseball? QuincyIs that so? If I were a boy, I'd rather play...
That's why I'm in the baseball club. If you're Quincy, why bother coming to see baseball? QuincyIs that so? If I were a boy, I'd rather play...
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Hey did you see it? Great play today.
It's professional. QuincyIt's not that great at all. QuincyI wonder if I can do it.
As expected, Professional is amazing. Quincy Even if you don't hold back that much... Quincy, if you try hard, you might be able to do it.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Doesn't it hurt to do that?
It hurts, but I'm training. Quincy Quincy It doesn't hurt.
Yeah really... It looks like you're taking it pretty well... Even Quincy doesn't look like that... Quincy Huh? Doesn't it hurt? is this for real….
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Pro wrestling is kind of scary to watch.
Sorry for inviting you. Shall we go home? What if I close my eyes Quincy? Quincy You'll get used to it.
That's what I meant to say, wasn't it? Thank you. Quincy You don't have to say that. QuincyI think so. But you gotta get used to it...
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
There are many beautiful fish.
It's art in the water. Quincy looks delicious. QuincyIt's really beautiful.
Nice, romantic. Quincy, why is that the only thing you can think of? Quincy There are beautiful fish over there too.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Sharks are so scary.
That mouth... It's scary after all. I've never fought a Quincy shark before. Quincy I'm not scared at all.
That's right. If attacked at sea... Quincy That's obvious. Quincy, do you really think so?
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The dolphin show you just saw was great.
Dolphins are smart. Quincy dolphins are mammals. Aren't Quincy dolphin teeth scary?
It's true. I'm impressed. Quincy I know. Quincy Right? But it's not cute.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Everyone is quietly studying.
Let us study quietly. Quincy Ah! Everyone is studying! Quincy It's true, it's quiet.
Yes. Let's do so…. Quincy How can you raise your voice so insensitively? Quincy Let's start quietly.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I'll fetch you a book. what would you like?
Well then, a technical book... I like Quincy comics. QuincyFor now, it's fine.
Understood. You read difficult books. There's no such thing as a Quincy manga. QuincyIs that so? You don't have to hold back.
Well then, let's go inside.
agree.
Ah, there's a hero show over there.
Invite Gargantua to go see it. Ignore the Quincy show at all.
Shiori, do you want to go see the hero show?
Eh, a hero show? I do not really….
okay let's go Quincy Let's not do that.
If you really want to say...
I was embarrassed to watch it with my child.
Sorry. i wanted to see... Quincy I don't care about people's eyes. I should have stopped watching Quincy...
Is that so…. It can't be helped. Quincy You may be, but I care. Quincy, from now on, be careful.
The person wearing the stuffed toy, It seems to be difficult.
I've heard it's hard. I've never worn Quincy before... It's easier than for Quincy shooting.
That's right... Isn't it rare that someone has worn Quincy? Quincy Huh? What is it for shooting?
So where are we going?
Let's ride a roller coaster. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
i love it Let's ride.
It was interesting.
That sense of speed is great. Quincy Isn't that childish? Quincy was pretty freaked out.
Was good. Ride with me... Quincy Bored? yes…. Quincy Ufufu, you're surprisingly cowardly.
It felt good.
The feeling of blowing that wind is irresistible. Quincy at least. Quincy I closed my eyes the whole time...
I might become a speed maniac in the future. Sounds like Quincy was boring... QuincyWere you that scared?
It's a little scary, but let's go in.
It was pretty scary.
It was okay because I was there. With that Quincy? Isn't it funny? Quincy is surprisingly cowardly.
Well let's keep it that way. Ufufufu. QuincyNo way. Anyone can have something that scares them. Even Quincy is me... I'm not that strong-minded...
It was scary, but the 3D images were beautiful.
It felt like you were really there. Quincy Huh? Because I had my eyes closed... QuincyYeah, it was.
I wonder if real ghosts are that beautiful...? QuincyEh, were you scared? Even I was watching... Quincy must have been scared. A trembling voice. Ufufufu….
It's pretty empty. Let's ride.
It was a nice view.
Because I was only looking at Shiori's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.
eh? That's embarrassing... But I'm happy... Quincy You must have been bored with me. When you look at Quincy from above, humans seem tiny.
Aren't you afraid of swaying in high places?
I was fine with Shiori. Quincy shaking? I didn't notice it at all. It might be the scariest ride in Quincy Park.
For real? Me too... Quincy is already insensitive... I wondered what I would do if Quincy fell.
So where are we going?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
It looks a little scary, but it's okay.
It's okay. Let's ride.
It was really thrilling.
My voice came out unintentionally. Quincy, what the hell am I doing now? Quincy, not at all. I wasn't scared.
I thought my heart would stop. Quincy Huh? what are you talking about Quincy hee hee hee. strange. I endure it...
No matter when you ride, it's amazing.
Oh, my heart is still pounding. Quincy Ugh, I feel sick... Quincy's eyes rolled.
My heart is still pounding. Quincy Tell me it's okay This is what it is Even Quincy is walking properly, so it seems to be okay.
It's a little scary, but let's go in.
It was pretty scary.
It was okay because I was there. With that Quincy? Isn't it funny? Quincy is surprisingly cowardly.
Well let's keep it that way. Ufufufu. QuincyNo way. Anyone can have something that scares them. Even Quincy is me... I'm not that strong-minded...
It was scary, but the 3D images were beautiful.
It felt like you were really there. Quincy Huh? Because I had my eyes closed... QuincyYeah, it was.

Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Ride the Quincy virtual ship. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
It looks a little scary, but it's okay.
It's okay. Let's ride.
It was really thrilling.
My voice came out unintentionally. Quincy, what the hell am I doing now? Quincy, not at all. I wasn't scared.
I thought my heart would stop. Quincy Huh? what are you talking about Quincy hee hee hee. strange. I endure it...
No matter when you ride, it's amazing.
Oh, my heart is still pounding. Quincy Ugh, I feel sick... Quincy's eyes rolled.
My heart is still pounding. Quincy Tell me it's okay This is what it is Even Quincy is walking properly, so it seems to be okay.
Sounds like a lot of fun. Let's go in.
It really felt like I was traveling in space.
When the meteor came, I was terrified. Quincy is childish after all. Quincy was amazing.
I was surprised too I clung to it. sorry. I think Quincy was good. Maybe it doesn't suit your tastes? QuincyIt was really good.
Human senses are pretty sloppy.
Thanks to that, you can have a lot of fun with it. QuincyIt's not like that, is it? QuincyYeah, I think it's like this.
That's right. Today was also a lot of fun. Quincy Well then, the current ride must have been boring. Quincy I think so.
It's pretty empty. Let's ride.
It was a nice view.
Because I was only looking at Shiori's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.
eh? That's embarrassing... But I'm happy... Quincy You must have been bored with me. When you look at Quincy from above, humans seem tiny.
Aren't you afraid of swaying in high places?
I was fine with Shiori. Quincy shaking? I didn't notice it at all. It might be the scariest ride in Quincy Park.
For real? Me too... Quincy is already insensitive... I wondered what I would do if Quincy fell.
Let's go for a walk then.
Let's go to the tree-lined street today.
Yeah let's go
It feels good to take a walk on a road like this.
It's like a scene from a romance novel. A Quincy walk will make you hungry. QuincyIt really feels good.
I thought so too. I've been longing for something like this... Quincy Yes. I was in a good mood, but... Quincy It seems that the daily fatigue is gone.
Let's go for a walk then.
Let's go to the pond today.
Yeah let's go
Beautiful pond. Are you restless?
I agree. Let's rest. A Quincy ghost might appear. Quincy Ah, there's a carp over there.
yes. There are benches, so let's sit together... Quincy was in a good mood, but... Quincy ah really. You're over there too.
Ah, the cherry blossoms are already blooming.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
Yeah let's go
It's already in full bloom. But it will be gone soon.
That's why it's beautiful. Quincy roads get dirty. Quincy Because that's the law of nature.
That's true, but it's kind of lonely. Quincy You're thinking about such things all the time. Quincy, you say things that are short-sighted.
Come on in.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
A true genius must have the heart to enjoy art.
Don't you think this picture is wonderful? QuincyThat person is beautiful... Quincy Doesn't this picture look like Gargantua?
Yes. I deserve what I deserve. QuincyYes. Good for you. Quincy, I don't think there's an intelligent face like me in this world.
Come on in.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I also like drawing pictures.
How nice. I want to see You should stop Quincy. I thought I was just watching Quincy.
But I won't. Painting is best done by someone else. Quincy What does that mean? QuincyI just thought it would be nice once in a while.
Come on in.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
It's a very relaxing picture.
I have a wide range of interests in painting. Quincy, where does this calm you down? I also like Quincy contemporary art.
Well, genius is like that. Quincy shut up. Apart from Quincy, it doesn't matter.
Come on in.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I wonder if my statue will look like this.
It would be cool if you could. Quincy what it. do you make something like that? Quincy isn't good.
Of course. Sounds like a good fit for me. QuincyYes. Do you have any complaints? Quincy, you're not joking, are you?
Come on in.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I feel like I have something in common with this person's drawing talent.
Both are geniuses. Quincy This painter is notorious for being weird. What is Quincy? I don't know.
yes. That's right. You know very well, don't you? Quincy Are you trying to tell me I'm a weirdo? Quincy, of course you don't know.
Come on in.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I saw you before.
I've seen this before.
You don't have to see the same thing.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go inside.
We split left and right.
Gargantua can get it. Quincy Gargantua will never get it. Quincy can handle it.
Calculate the rotational moment of the ball and the accompanying reflection of the pin... Excuse me Quincy. It's unpleasant. Quincy I can't get it if I don't calculate properly.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go inside.
Moving your body once in a while is good for turning your head.
Oh yeah, sometimes. Quincy should exercise more. Quincy is also a change of pace.
It can't be helped even if I improve my head rotation more than this. Quincy I don't have time for that. QuincyYes.
It's show time.
Come on, let's get in.
Here, Gargantua, over here.
Did you like the concert? The Quincy concert was boring, wasn't it? The Quincy concert was so-so, wasn't it?
Well, it was a good performance. Quincy doesn't understand art at all. Quincy Right? It was a good performance.
This kind of imbecile music is going to rot my brain. It suits you. QuincyYes. I wanted to listen to more sophisticated music. Quincy It's not good at all. It didn't feel like dignity.
I'd like some more upscale music. QuincyIt's not that bad. It would be nice if it was more classy. Quincy, you're right.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I want this many animals for research.
That should be enough. Quincy That's a pity. Can you keep Quincy this much?
With this many animals, we can conduct experiments one step ahead. Quincy is too sweet. Modern human society is built on these sacrifices. Quincy, but not right now.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What do you think of lions?
The strongest animal... Nothing apart from Quincy…. Quincy cat.
After all, yes. I want to synthesize this gene. QuincyYes. If that's the case, I don't mind. Quincy That's right.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What did you think of the koala you just saw?
I was afraid of my eyes Quincy is cute. Quincy is so cute!
That's their nature. Aren't Quincy's appearances deceiving her? A little bit of Quincy, it seems like you can see the essence.
Once in a while, It's good to take a break.
Can I invite you again next time?
If only I had time.
Well then, I'll contact you again.
Well, sometimes it's nice to have a day off when you don't do research.
That was good.
It was boring, but I'll tolerate it today.
oh yeah... Thank you.
Once in a while, It's good to take a break.
Can I invite you again next time?
I don't want to be overly friendly, but that's fine.

I'm a little late with my research, but that's okay.
oh yeah... Thank you.
It was boring at all.

Hey, it's familiar.

I'm late with my research, but that's okay.
oh yeah... Thank you.
I'm just tired.
oh yeah...
What I did was a miscalculation.
‥‥‥‥. (Did I make you angry?)
It was fun, right?
yes. It was a lot of fun.
It was the same place as before. I can't help but get bored of the same place over and over again.
Oh, was that right? (Oops, I should have checked more.)
Come to think of it, the poetry collection I received yesterday is alright.
You read it. Thank you.

Once in a while, that's fine.
Well then, Shall we go goldfish scooping?
Yes. Please do as you please.
Yes, I will give it to Gargantua.

Shall we play ring toss then?
I can't get a good one anyway.
If I get it, I'll give it to Gargantua.
I won't do it
I'll do it.
I can't get it unless I calculate it properly.
You know, don't you? That's how it is.
Well, that's what it is.
There will be a fireworks display this year. let's go
Yes. OK.
It's not pretty.
Rising Dragon Turbulence Shichihenge is that guy. Quincy sparklers are better. QuincyIt's really beautiful.

You're going to enter a place like this.
Let's go inside.
Go to the video game corner. Go to the Quincy medal game corner.
This kind of thing is silly.
Well then, let's go home... QuincyThere are a lot of girls these days. Do you hate QuincyGargantua?
Yes. Even staying here is a waste of time. Quincy What happened? QuincyYes.
What kind of games do you think are fun?
It's shooting. How about a Quincy crane game? I think Quincy puzzles are interesting.
If this is the case, it should be enough to satisfy the destructive desires of humans. Quincy, even if I take something like this, I'm not happy at all. Quincy There's no point in using your head for something like this.
It's not real money, but is it fun?
It's fun to do things like this. It's pretty popular with Quincy girls. QuincyI like this atmosphere.
Well, I don't know. Because it's Quincy? I didn't answer your question. Quincy hmm. yes.
If you can analyze this kind of algorithm, it's easy.
Hmm. I see. Can you analyze Quincy? Quincy Well, give it a try.
that's right. I'm not interested so I won't. Quincy No way. You're making a fool of me Quincy It's a hassle, so I won't do it.
waited?
Besides, I'm not waiting. It's on time.
I'm glad I wasn't late.
waited?
separately. You're on time.
I'm glad I wasn't late.
waited?
Besides, I'm not waiting.
I'm glad I wasn't late.
Gargantua, sorry. I made a small mistake, and I'm late.
I can't help it. Because I can't force you to be perfect.
Was good. (I thought you would be more angry.)
Gargantua, sorry. I made a small mistake, and I'm late.
You're willing to keep me waiting. It makes me laugh.
sorry. It was bad.
Gargantua, sorry. I made a small mistake, and I'm late.
You'll do something interesting. You're late at 37:45:14.
Sorry. I won't do it again. (Don't go into too much detail.)
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥.
Hey, Gargantua…. wait.
After all, I can escape with this outfit.
It can not be helped. are you going home
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Because I don't sing You can sing whatever you want.
Let's stop then. Quincy Gargantua, just sing. Quincy Then take my word for it.
yes? It's okay to sing separately. Quincy, it's a waste to let you listen. Quincy For now, I'll listen to you.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
It's just music that melts your brain.
How about a ballad system? Quincy Sing what you like. What kind of Quincy would you like?
Well then you can listen. Quincy I don't sing Quincy think for yourself.
Well, once in a while, this kind of place is good too.

Not so much. QuincyIt's not that bad. I wish it was more destructive. Quincy, you're right.
Come to think of it, there should be a parade today.
Invite them to watch the parade. Quincy pretends not to know and goes home.
Waste of electricity. I want you to make more intelligent things.
No matter how many times I see it, it's a useless parade.
‥‥‥. That's right. (He doesn't seem to like it...)

It's hot and my head feels dizzy.
I'll buy you some juice too. It's Quincy summer. Why don't you go into the Quincy Sea?

Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I want to raise it to this size for research purposes.
What research are you using? Quincy Let's enjoy looking at beautiful flowers. I wonder if I can eat Quincy.
It's a secret. I have a lot of things I want to do, and I'm in trouble. Quincy just isn't worth raising. Try Quincy and you'll understand. Here you go.
Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I'd like to modify the carnivorous plant.
What do you want to build? You can't Quincy. What if you like Quincy?

I just bought a lot.

I hate Gargantua. Quincy is so cute, isn't she? QuincyYeah, yeah. I think so too.
Of course. I have no idea who comes to a place like this. Quincy, aren't you crazy? What are you here for, Quincy? stupid.
This is rather good.
Eh, this one with bullets? Quincy Huh, this koala guy? Quincy Huh, this colorful one?
If it's this, I think I'll get it. Quincy brain, isn't it rotten? QuincyThat's not it. what were you looking at
After all, shopping is here.

It's surprising that you know how good this is. Quincy I'm sorry for being an ordinary person. It's unpleasant. Quincy, of course. Do you have anything else to buy?
No matter when you come, it's a nice place.
There's a better place Quincy Right? It's boring. Quincy So-so..., I guess.
It's hard to know such a place. Quincy I don't know what's good about this place I don't like ignorance. It's okay if you don't know each Quincy.

What's the fun in baseball?
You don't like Gargantua? Apart from Quincy, it's not funny. QuincyI don't know, but it's funny.

Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What will happen when you win?
That's right, (explains). Quincy I don't know either. Quincy I won't tell you.

Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Well, it's more interesting than baseball, but it's still boring.
Which part is boring? QuincyI hate professional wrestling too. Quincy is so funny.

Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I want this much for research.
This is enough. QuincyEven though you're so beautiful? Quincy looks delicious.

Then let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Don't you like sharks?
But sharks are scary. I don't know what's good about Quincy. I like Quincy.

Then let's go inside.
agree.
Ah, there's a hero show over there.
Invite Gargantua to go see it. Ignore the Quincy show at all.
Gargantua, would you like to go see a hero show?
I don't want to see that.
okay let's go Quincy Let's not do that.
nothing I can do about it.
It's really boring. I'm going home
I came all the way here.
Wait a second. I remembered the use.
Mr. Himo, where did you go...?
I made you wait. Come on, let's go.
-It's hard to hear a man's voice. Hero is fainting.
Something seems to be going on behind the scenes...
It doesn't matter. Hurry up, let's go.
Mr. Himo. what were you doing
Where are you going?
Let's ride a roller coaster. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
It's a boring vehicle.
It's boring at all.
That's childish. Quincy was pretty freaked out. QuincyThat sense of speed is great.
Yes. It's good to trick children. Quincy, what kind of nerves do you have? Quincy, it's just right for you.
No matter how many times I ride it, it's boring.
Oh yeah. sorry. QuincyI thought so. QuincyAre you feeling good?
I wish I knew Quincy You knew it, but you rode it. QuincyI don't think so.
Anyway, it's boring, but I'll go in.
After all, it was boring.
I think so too. QuincySurprisingly, it was scary. Quincy stereoscopic video was beautiful.
I can't believe I used this precious technology for such an unrealistic thing. Quincy is a pretty funny joke. Quincy I don't want you to use that technology for that kind of thing.
No matter how many times I see it, it's boring.
Oh yeah. sorry. QuincyI thought so. The Quincy stereoscopic video was beautiful, wasn't it?
I wish I knew Quincy You knew it, but you went in. QuincyThat's it.
Are you going to ride something like this? Well, okay.
I feel like I wasted so much time.
I was really sleepy. Quincy Isn't that a nice view? I was just watching Quincy Gargantua...
Well, of course it is. I will forgive you this time. At the Quincy satellite level, though, I'd be tempted to see it. Quincy why did you ride this crap?
I have nothing to do.
What if you could rest your head? Why don't you look at the Quincy scenery? It's fun with QuincyGargantua.
That's a good idea. Quincy There's no point in looking at boring things. What is Quincy? I don't understand.
Where are you going?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
It's quite a heavy-duty machine, isn't it?
Let's ride.
It's not that scary, it's not that interesting.
I wasn't scared at all. Quincy was so thrilling. Quincy I like it, but...
Yes. I don't want you to call yourself a screaming machine like this. Quincy I'm so lucky to be able to be scared like that. Once you know Quincy's true horror, you won't like it.
My experiments are more thrilling.
That sounds interesting. Quincy Stop that dangerous experiment. Quincy Yes, that's right.
Come visit us next time. I will allow it. Quincy it doesn't matter to you. QuincyYes. Once you come to see
Anyway, it's boring, but I'll go in.

Where are you going?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Ride the Quincy virtual ship. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
It's quite a heavy-duty machine, isn't it?
Let's ride.
It's not that scary, it's not that interesting.
I wasn't scared at all. Quincy was so thrilling. Quincy I like it, but...
Yes. I don't want you to call yourself a screaming machine like this. Quincy I'm so lucky to be able to be scared like that. Once you know Quincy's true horror, you won't like it.

Come on, let's get on.
It's a bit lacking in reality.
eh? yes? QuincyNo way. Even with Quincy, it was fun.
that's right. Do your research and you'll know. Quincy, have you ever been on a spaceship? Quincy, but that's true.
It pisses me off at being deceived by a machine like this.
I wasn't feeling well today. Not good for Quincy. I felt like I was riding Quincy.
Yes. That's right. Quincy not good. I am in a machine like this... Quincy, it's noisy...
Are you going to ride something like this? Well, okay.
I feel like I wasted so much time.
I was really sleepy. Quincy Isn't that a nice view? I was just watching Quincy Gargantua...
Well, of course it is. I will forgive you this time. At the Quincy satellite level, though, I'd be tempted to see it. Quincy why did you ride this crap?
I have nothing to do.
What if you could rest your head? Why don't you look at the Quincy scenery? It's fun with QuincyGargantua.
That's a good idea. Quincy There's no point in looking at boring things. What is Quincy? I don't understand.
To rest your head Well, it might be good.
Let's go to the tree-lined street today.
nothing I can do about it.
It's a nice view. I'm sure you'll come up with a good idea.
So keep quiet. It's like a scene from a Quincy romance novel. A Quincy walk will make you hungry.
Really nice. Quincy what are you talking about? It's rubbish. It consumes Quincy energy.
To rest your head Well, it might be good.
Let's go to the pond today.
nothing I can do about it.
Looking at the pond makes me want to study fluid mechanics.
As expected, I think differently. Quincy Don't think about that. QuincyIt's a little difficult for me.
It's obvious. If you compare me to ordinary people, I will be in trouble. Quincy It's up to me. Quincy In your head, it's impossible.
The cherry blossoms are blooming.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
Well, once in a while, it's nice to enjoy something like this.
It's not pretty.
After that, the road will be dirty. It's not like Quincy Gargantua. Quincy is a flower that represents Japan.
I'll set my sights on a pretty good spot. Quincy Quincy, you'll be my flower soon.
Let's go inside.

Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
That's great. It looks great no matter how many times I see it.
This is art. Quincy What's so good about this? Quincy You often see this person's paintings.

Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Hey, don't you think this bronze statue has a wonderful sense of dynamism?

I don't think so. Quincy I don't think it's that boring... QuincyYes. It was okay.
Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Don't you think that just being an animal makes a picture?
Especially in nature. Quincy at all. I don't want to be a picture. QuincyI think so.

Which do you prefer, watching baseball or actually playing it?

Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Hey, is baseball that much fun?
i really like it... Quincy is not funny at all. What about Quincy Gargantua?
I thought you said that. That's right. If it was Quincy, you shouldn't have come to see it. If you just watch Quincy, you're right.
Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Oooooh, that looks painful.
It hurts, but I'm training. Quincy It doesn't hurt. Quincy
When humans train, they become stronger. QuincyThat's not true. What is Quincy?

Oh, that's right. OK. Then it can't be helped. Quincy Unbelievable. I can't do that. QuincyYes. I wanted you to think about it first.
Hey, stuffed animals seem to be difficult.
I've heard it's hard. I've never worn Quincy before... It's easier than for Quincy shooting.

So where are we going?
Let's ride a roller coaster. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.

That sense of speed is great. Quincy Isn't that childish? Quincy was pretty freaked out.
Mmmeetu. I think so too. Quincy Maybe so, but I like it. Quincy is surprisingly cowardly.
Feel so good. It felt good.
The feeling of blowing that wind is irresistible. Quincy at least. Quincy I closed my eyes the whole time...
That's it. That's it after all. QuincyYes, I hate it. Quincy Huh, eyes? What, you're surprisingly cowardly.
Come on let's go. Let's go in.
I was really scared.

Its so beautiful. It was a nice visual.
It felt like you were really there. Quincy Huh? Because I had my eyes closed... QuincyYeah, it was.

It was a nice view.
Yeah, it was a nice view. QuincyAh, I was sleepy. I was just looking at QuincyGargantua's face...
Hey, it was really beautiful. QuincyAre you bored with me? Quincy Huh? That's what you can see anytime.
At that high place, it shook.
I was fine with Gargantua. It might be the scariest ride in Quincy Park. Quincy shaking? I didn't notice it at all.
Thank you. I didn't think it was that scary. QuincyThat's an exaggeration. There's no reason for that. Quincy is quite sensitive, isn't he?
So where are we going?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
That looks scary, but shall we take a ride?

Huh, that sounds interesting. Why don't you come in for a minute?
Yay, it was real. It really felt like I went on a space trip.
When the meteor came, I was terrified. Quincy is childish after all. Quincy was amazing.
Im so surprised. I also avoided it for a while. Quincy Right? I was very good Quincy Meet. I think so too.
Human senses are pretty sloppy.
Thanks to that, you can have a lot of fun with it. QuincyIt's not like that, is it? QuincyYeah, I think it's like this.
Uright. Exactly. Quincy Isn't it strange to think so? QuincyIt's like this, isn't it?
Come on, let's ride.
It was a nice view.

Shall we walk for a while?
Let's go to the tree-lined street today.
OK, that's fine.
It feels refreshing to take a walk on a road like this.
Aren't you hungry for a walk? It's like a scene from a Quincy romance novel. QuincyIt really feels good.
Eh, ah, yes. Actually, I thought so too. Quincy sorry. I don't read that sort of thing. Quincy Phew, I'm getting sleepy.

The cherry blossoms are already blooming.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
OK, that's fine.
Oh, that's beautiful. But it's a shame it's gone.
That's why it's beautiful. Quincy roads get dirty. Quincy Because that's the law of nature.
Yes. It might be a beauty that can't be seen in the picture. Quincy has zero artistic sense. QuincyThat's right.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
what are you looking at?
Don't you think this picture is beautiful? QuincyThat person is beautiful... Quincy Doesn't this picture look like Gargantua?
Yes. Not so-so. Quincy, I couldn't hear you very well. Can you say that again? Dear Quincy, please don't compare me to this level.
Oh, no. Today's Gargantua is even more beautiful...
yes…. That's fine.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Oh, isn't this abstract painting nice?
As expected of Gargantua. I know how good it is. Quincy is just a scribble. Tell me what Quincy stands for.

What do you say?
Art has to be beautiful like me.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
This bronze statue is quite impressive.
Yeah, great work. Quincy Even though this is a replica? Quincy I like the guy next door.
It's worth it to match my glasses. Is it a Quincy replica? I'm only interested in the real thing. Quincy, you have no eye for beauty.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The picture of this person is quite good.
You're good at it. Quincy Do you like this picture? Quincy I'm a fan.
It looks like you've come to appreciate beauty a little bit, too. Quincy, you don't understand how good this is. QuincyI've never heard of that.
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What do you mean by bringing me here again?

Gargantua can get it. Quincy Gargantua will never get it. Quincy can handle it.
Hohohoho. That's right, with my good looks, it's an easy win. Quincy It's noisy. Even if I could do something like this, it would be of no use. Quincy replacement. So what can you do for me?
Well then, let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
If I do this, I will gain muscle.
Moderate exercise is good for beauty. Quincy Why don't you exercise a little more? QuincyYes. Shall we stop now?
I wonder if that's right? Then just a little more... Quincy Quincy I will.
It's about time for the show to start. Let's go inside early.
I agree. Let's go in early.

at all. Think more carefully about what pleases me. QuincyYes. It was boring. Quincy Right? It was boring.

I shouldn't have come to a place like this.
‥‥‥‥. (Did I make you angry?)
thank you for your attend.
If it's okay with me, I'll be with you anytime.
Didn't you come to this place just recently?

Will you take it, won't you take it?
Okay, I'll take it, I'll take it
Now I have a nice souvenir for my brothers.
This kind of adult game is perfect for me.
I like this atmosphere. Aren't you a Quincy gambler? QuincyIt's pretty popular with girls.
Yes. You know, don't you? Quincy, please don't hang out with those rude people. It has nothing to do with Quincy.
Hohohohoho. Look at this coin. It's a little thing, isn't it?
amazing. Aren't you a genius? Isn't the Quincy machine broken? Quincy, give me some.
Hohohohoho. In front of my good looks, even a machine dangles. It's disrespectful to bend Quincy. Come on Quincy. Take as many as you like.

Sorry. i wanted to see... Quincy I don't care about people's eyes. I should have stopped watching Quincy...
‥‥‥‥. I know that all too well. Quincy.... Are you going to piss me off any more? Quincy.... It's too late...
People who wear stuffed animals have a hard time.

This is what children see. I will never go in.
Let's stop. Quincy must be scared. Leave it to Quincy Gargantua.
Yes. let's stop. Quincy It's useless to say that. I can't go in. Quincy, then let's stop.
do you want to laugh at me again? I will never go in.
It can't be helped, should I give up?
It's pretty empty. Let's ride.
It was boring, but the scenery was okay.
I was just looking at Gargantua's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.
If you put me in front of you, that's natural. Hohohoho. Quincy Shall I wake you up? Quincy, you can give me a ride sometime soon.
I was a little scared of swaying in high places.
Shake? I didn't notice it at all. Quincy Aren't you a coward? If Quincy falls, you might die.
Is it because you were fascinated by me? Then of course it is. Hohohoho. Quincy, it's noisy. I don't want to tell you Quincy Losing me like this would be the biggest loss in the world.
Where are you going?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
Hey, that sounds scary. I don't want to.
It's okay. Let's ride.
Well, as expected, there was nothing more than a screaming machine.
Oh, my heart is still pounding. Quincy Ugh, I feel sick... Quincy's eyes rolled.
Well, it was pretty good, wasn't it? Quincy is ugly, so don't throw up. Quincy Let's take a break.
I screamed so much that I almost lost my voice.
I want to hear your hoarse voice. Don't shout Quincy. Quincy, aren't you still okay?
Hohohoho. It's too much for you. Quincy Before that, you should get on. QuincyYes. But I'm a little tired of screaming.
This is what children see. I will never go in.
Let's stop. Quincy must be scared. Leave it to Quincy Gargantua.
Yes. let's stop. Quincy It's useless to say that. I can't go in. Quincy, then let's stop.

I want to hear your hoarse voice. Don't shout Quincy. Quincy, aren't you still okay?
Hohohoho. It's too much for you. Quincy Before that, you should get on. QuincyYes. But I'm a little tired of screaming.
It looks like a lot of fun. Let's go in.
I kind of liked this.
As expected of Gargantua, you have a good eye. Quincy kidding? Quincy is pretty good, isn't it?
don't know, but it feels good. Praise me more. Hohohoho. Quincy, if I admit it, you're not kidding me. Correct me. Quincy If it's like this, you can enter again.
People's senses are sloppy, aren't they?
That's why it's good, isn't it? Quincy I don't care, I got drunk. QuincyCan't believe your senses?
Yes. There are certainly places like that. Quincy I'm sorry. A little Quincy. But I enjoyed it so it's okay.
It's pretty empty. Let's ride.
It was boring, but the scenery was okay.
I was just looking at Gargantua's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.

I can't help it, so I'll take you for a walk.
Well then, let's go to the tree-lined street.
Yes.
It's okay to do this once in a while.
It feels really good. A Quincy walk will make you hungry. It's like a scene from a Quincy romance novel.
I don't really like this kind of place, but I'll forgive you today. Quincy.... It's ruining my mood. Quincy, are you not good enough to play against me?
I can't help it, so I'll take you for a walk.
Let's go to the pond today.
Yes.
I'm a little tired.
Let's rest on the bench then. Quincy This place looks like it could be haunted. Quincy Ah, there's a carp over there.
It's a dirty bench. Can you lay out a handkerchief, too? Quincy, what nonsense are you talking about? See, I'll go right away. Quincy says I'm tired. Why don't you take care of yourself a little?
It looks like the cherry blossoms are blooming.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
Yes. It's okay
It's not a good thing.
But it's no match for Gargantua. QuincyIs that so? at all. Quincy true. That's beautiful.
Hohohoho. It's obvious. Quincy, it was a mistake to ask you. Quincy Well, not as good as I am.
Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
You have a lot of nice pictures.
Don't you think this picture is beautiful? QuincyThat person is beautiful... Quincy This picture looks like Gargantua.

That's a great picture. How can I draw a picture like this?
You're a talented person. Quincy Anyone can draw, can't they? Quincy practice only.

Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
For me, this kind of picture is a bit...
That's right. sorry. Quincy This is art. QuincyI hate pictures like this...

Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
This bronze statue. It looks like it's starting to move now?
Yeah, great work. Quincy Even though this is a replica? Quincy I like the guy next door.
After all, do you think so? I don't think it's related to Quincy, but... QuincyThat's right. Nice work, isn't it?
Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
A great picture attracts the viewer.

Shall we go inside?
I agree. Let's go inside.
My arm hurts already.
Let's stop then. Quincy I'll do it until my arm breaks. Quincy Shall we make a lighter ball?

Ah, it's time to start the show. If we don't get inside soon...
I agree. Let's go in early.
Our seats...
Here, Gargantua, over here.
Did you like the concert? The Quincy concert was boring, wasn't it? The Quincy concert was so-so, wasn't it?
It was a great performance. I was impressed. QuincyI see... I thought it was a great performance, but... QuincyIs that so...? But I thought it was great.
Is that so…. I like classical music, but... Quincy I thought so too. I prefer more calm music. Quincy I'm rather not a fan.
agree. I don't hate it either. QuincyThat's right. I don't like it either. QuincyThat's right. I think so too….
Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
It's so hot that I feel dizzy.
It's hard, I have to rest somewhere. Quincy It's okay. It's just my imagination. Quincy What should I do?
Thank you. excuse me. make you worry…. Quincy Ah, no more... I'm sorry Quincy. For now, can you give me a break?
Ah, Kisaragi-san. All right? (I wish I could have rested...)
Shall we go inside?
I agree. Shall we go inside?

How about this silver necklace? Quincy How about this skull ring? Quincy How about this colorful one?

Really? Then it can't be helped. Quincy I'm really worried about it... QuincyThat's right.
People who wear stuffed animals, It seems difficult.
I've heard it's hard. I've never worn Quincy before... It's easier than for Quincy shooting.
After all, that's right... Quincy I think that's a given, but... What is Quincy photography?

I was scared after all.
sorry. I'll be careful next time. With that Quincy? It's not funny. Quincy I was a little scared too.
Thank you. Thank you for taking care of me... That's enough for me, Quincy. Quincy Then don't ride too much...
No matter how many times you ride it, you will never get used to it.
But you've gotten used to it, haven't you? Quincy ok, ride until you get used to it. QuincyI'm really not good at it.
If you say so, it may be so, but... In the Quincy series, it's a bit impossible. I think I've said Quincy many times, but...
It's a little scary, isn't it?
After all, it was scary.
It was okay because I was there. With that Quincy? Isn't it funny? Quincy Gargantua, you're a coward.
Yes. I was fine…. I don't think it's strange for Quincy, but... QuincyThat's right. It has been said for a long time.
I was so scared that I almost closed my eyes.
The stereoscopic image was beautiful, but... Quincy, did you close your eyes? It's boring. Quincy me too me too
I'm no good with ghosts... QuincyI don't mind if people say it's boring. Quincy, you were surprisingly cowardly...
I love it. Let's ride.

That's so embarrassing... Quincy sounds boring. Quincy Did you think so?
Aren't you afraid of swaying in high places?
was fine with Gargantua. Quincy shaking? I didn't notice it at all. It might be the scariest ride in Quincy Park.
For real? Me too... Quincy Hey, aren't you too insensitive? I wondered what I would do if Quincy fell.
where shall we go?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.

It really felt like I was traveling in space.
When the meteor came, I was terrified. Quincy is childish after all. Quincy was amazing.
It was a great ride. It was nice to ride with you. Quincy I thought it was pretty good, but... Quincy Did you think so?
It would be fun if various things could be experienced virtually.
I think so. Quincy not fun at all. Making Quincy is hard work.
Really, if that happens... I want to come with you again... QuincyI don't like this kind of thing. QuincyThat's right. That seems tough.

I often read in this park when it's cool.
Let's go to the tree-lined street today.

The cherry blossoms are already blooming.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
Sounds good. let's go.
It's already in full bloom. It's sad that they'll be gone soon, but...
That's why it's beautiful. Quincy roads get dirty. Quincy Because that's the law of nature.
But I don't want beautiful love to be fleeting. QuincyIt's a pity that I only pay attention to places like that... Quincy is impermanent... But if that's all there is to it, it's kind of dull.

Then I'll come change.
If you overcook it, it will hurt.
yes. I have to do it moderately. Quincy I'm okay with this much. A little more Quincy would be nice.
Yes Yes. It's not good to bake it suddenly. Quincy It's only now that I can say that. Quincy is fine, but... I think you should be careful.
Then I'll come change.
Gargantua, you are sleeping comfortably.
Put the juice on your cheek. Graffiti on the Quincy Sunscreen! Quincy, let's just leave it alone.
Kyaa. I was surprised. Juice, thank you. QuincyHey what are you doing? Don't play tricks like that. Quincy Oh, I'm sorry. I think I fell asleep

There are many beautiful flowers.
When I look at flowers, my heart softens. QuincyIs this beautiful? I wonder if I can eat Quincy.

Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go inside.
Flowers brighten the mood.
Sometimes it cheers me up. Shall we take Quincy home? QuincyI think so too.

So where shall we go shopping?
Let's go see clothes. Let's go see some Quincy accessories. Let's go to the Quincy junk shop.
yes. let's go. Quincy Yeah. let's go. Quincy the junkie? I'll leave it to you...
I'm the kind of person who doesn't care about clothes.
Then I will watch it with you. Is Quincy really a girl? Quincy why?
Thank you. But aren't you ashamed? All right? Quincy Huh? Oh, do you see a boy? I don't really look at clothes because I only do Quincy club activities.
When you come shopping once in a while, you buy a lot.
Here, I'll bring it. I'm tired of hanging out with Quincy. QuincySeriously, a lot.
Eh, that's fine. Because it's bad... QuincyEh, about that much...? No…. sorry. Quincy, you bought a lot.
It's not bad, can you lend it to me?
sorry. Thank you.
Isn't this cute?
Yeah, it looks great on Gargantua. Quincy I don't think so. Quincy is pretty cute too.
Thank you. Even if you compliment me, I'm happy. Quincy Well, yeah... Quincy true. Cute.
I don't buy many accessories... which one would suit me?
How about this colorful one? Quincy How about this silver necklace? Quincy How about this skull ring?
Wow, it's a little flashy, but I like this sort of thing. I think Quincy is good, but maybe it could be a little more flashy... Quincy I don't like this kind of thing.
Huh, there was a place like this too.
I'm in a bad mood, though. Quincy, of course. I like the atmosphere of Quincy.
That's not true. I don't like places like this. Quincy, is that so? I don't hate Quincy either, but I can't say I like it...
No matter how many times I come here, the atmosphere is amazing.
sorry. It'll be over soon. Quincy go to a more amazing place? Quincy must come more often...
Eh, don't worry about me. You can come and see me slowly. Quincy I'd like to refrain from doing that... Even Quincy doesn't want to get used to it...
Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I can't ski very well.
I'll tell you QuincyIt's sly on ice, isn't it? Let's practice together Quincy.

Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The ice is melting It's hard when you fall.
I will support you. Quincy It's just a matter of not falling. Quincy I didn't bring a change of clothes.
For real? Please help me practice. Quincy Well, that's right, but... Quincy dries so you'll be fine.
Shall we slide then?
agree.
Are you good at skiing?
If you want to ski, leave it to me. Quincy sleds have confidence though. Quincy I can skate for now.
Was good. Tell me then. Quincy Well, that's right... Well then, let's do our best to get off. Quincy Let's go down slowly.
Shall we slide then?
agree.
copper? Isn't ski wear weird?
It fits well and is cute. Quincy doesn't suit me at all. Quincy isn't weird.
For real? I'm happy to be flattered. Quincy, right? Maybe so. QuincyThat's good.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I love watching baseball.
prefer to play QuincyIs it that funny? Quincy I like watching too.
Boys prefer it. I will support you next time. I don't really like Quincy... Even with Quincy, I want boys to actually play it.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Hey, did you see it? Great play today.
It's professional. QuincyIt's not that great at all. QuincyI wonder if I can do it too.
For real. I was a little moved. Quincy, right? what's amazing? If Quincy works hard, I'm sure.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
When you see them fighting hard, don't you want to cheer them on?
People who work hard are cool. Isn't Quincy a hoax? You like to support Quincy.
yes. I think so too. Quincy I don't think so. Quincy That's what my friends often tell me.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Whoa, that hurts. Great, you look hurt. Hey, are you okay?
It's because they have different roots. It's okay. Quincy It's definitely a phony. Quincy Normally, you'd die.
That's right. I'm sure you've been practicing a lot... Quincy Well, that may be true, but I don't think it's rude to people who work hard. QuincyYeah, right. I'm a little worried.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go in.
There are many beautiful fish.
Really beautiful. Quincy looks delicious. Quincy Art in the water.
I think it's beautiful after all. Quincy Well, I think so, but... A little bit…. QuincyI'm not sure, but... Somehow I don't think so either.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go in.
Doesn't it look like fish eyes are unmotivated?
Is it so if you say so? QuincyHey, isn't that weird? You can't judge just by Quincy's eyes...
Somehow you would think so. Quincy, right? But I don't think it's the right way to say it... QuincyYeah, yeah. Yeah, I regret it.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go in.
The dolphin show I just saw was interesting.
Dolphins are smart. Quincy dolphins are mammals. Aren't Quincy dolphin teeth scary?

Let's go inside.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Everyone is quietly studying.
Let us study quietly. Quincy Ah! Everyone is studying! Quincy It's true, it's quiet.

Let's go inside.
agree.
Ah, there's a hero show over there.
Invite Gargantua to go see it. Ignore the Quincy show at all.
Gargantua, do you want to go see the hero show?
Eh, a hero show? Oh yeah, that's fine.
Let's go then.
I'm embarrassed to watch it with my child...
Sorry. Because I wanted to see... Quincy I don't care about people's eyes. I should have stopped watching Quincy...
Ah, that's fine. It's okay once in a while. Quincy Still, I'm curious. Quincy is fine. I've seen it already.
A person wearing a stuffed animal seems to be in trouble...
I've heard it's hard. I've never worn Quincy before... It's easier than for Quincy shooting.
I've heard that too. It's so hot. Quincy, right? That's normal... Quincy I'm not sure, is that so?
So where are we going?
Let's ride a roller coaster. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
Let's ride.
It wasn't that scary.
I agree. Not really. Quincy was so scary. QuincyIt wasn't scary at all.
don't you. Even if it's more scary than this, I'm in trouble... I think you don't have enough Quincy guts. Quincy wasn't that scary.
It feels great.
Is he the one who cuts the wind? Quincy seems a little drunk. Quincy, what makes you feel good?
yes. Maybe that's what it feels like. QuincyEh, are you okay? QuincyI guess it's the sense of speed...
Let's go in.
It was really scary.
It was okay because I was there. With that Quincy? Isn't it funny? Quincy Gargantua, you're a coward.
Ufufu…. I don't know how it is. Quincy, I guess so... Quincy Well, that might be true...
Don't you think the 3D image was beautiful?
It was really beautiful. Quincy Did that make you think so? Quincy
Just don't be afraid of that part. Wasn't Quincy beautiful...? Quincy I guess you didn't feel so beautiful.
Let's ride.
It looked good from afar.
I was just looking at Gargantua's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.
Eh, it's a little embarrassing. Quincy Sounds like it was boring. Quincy, you could even see my house.
Didn't it shake a lot at a high place?
This Ferris wheel has no guts. Quincy shaking? I didn't notice it at all. QuincyThis thing is rather swaying.
Ufufu. Maybe so. Quincy Huh? didn't you notice? I shook like that... Quincy Yes, that's right. I feel relieved.
So where are we going?
Let's ride the screaming machine, Vivir. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
This looks pretty scary.
It's okay. Let's ride.
That's amazing. I'm done with this
It's okay, your face is blue. It's not like you don't have enough Quincy guts. Quincy I won't force myself to invite you.
It's okay. Thank you. Quincy Well, that might be true, but... If you ride more than this, it will be troublesome. QuincyOh, thank you. sorry.
I don't want to ride anymore.
I'm sorry, let's just stop. Quincy Don't you want to ride Quincy?
sorry. Thank you. Quincy I want to do that, but it's going to cause you trouble... QuincyAre you so disappointed? sorry.
Let's go in.
It was really scary.

sorry. Thank you. Quincy I want to do that, but it's going to cause you trouble... QuincyAre you so disappointed? sorry.
Sounds like a lot of fun.
It really felt like I was traveling in space.
When the meteor came, I was terrified. Quincy is childish after all. Quincy was amazing.
For real. I was surprised too. Quincy, right? Wasn't it fun? QuincyI thought so too.
I wish there were more vehicles like this.
I think so. Quincy Not good at all. Making Quincy is hard work.
Looking forward to it. Quincy, right? I hate it so much... Even Quincy, do your best I want you to make it.
Let's ride.
It looked good from afar.
I was just looking at Gargantua's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.

Let's go for a walk then.
Let's go to the tree-lined street today.
Yes. let's go.
If it's a road like this, I think I'll be able to run comfortably.
I agree. You look good. Quincy I don't have that kind of guts. Sounds like a Quincy sports drama.
You would think so. I want to run with you next time. Quincy, right? I don't know how to give up from the beginning. Quincy, right? I actually like it.
Let's go for a walk then.
Let's go to the pond today.
Yes. let's go.
Beautiful pond. It seems to blow away the fatigue of the day.
agree. Let's rest. Quincy I'm getting tired. Shall we run around Quincy Pond?
Let's sit on the bench and talk. Dear Quincy, I'm sorry. I don't even know how you feel... Quincy That's fine, but let's get some rest for now.
The cherry blossoms are already blooming.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
yes. let's go.
It's already in full bloom... Ah, I wish I had brought a lunch.
Sorry, I wanted to eat lunch. Quincy No, cherry blossoms are enough. Anything without Quincy can't be helped.
sorry. On this next occasion, I'm sure... QuincyYes…. I don't want to eat... QuincyYes. I can't help it if I don't have it.
Shall we go inside, then?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I have many pictures.
There are many strange pictures. Quincy This picture looks like Gargantua. Quincy Don't you think this picture is beautiful?
yes. But this hen-chiklin painting, graceful, I like it. Quincy is different. She's not that kind of graceful lady. Quincy Yumi, I prefer manga.
Shall we go inside, then?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
This picture of the field is beautiful. how do i draw
You're a talented person. Quincy Anyone can draw, can't they? Quincy practice only.
guess so. Quincy eh. You can never be graceful. Quincy Yumi is good at manga though.
Shall we go inside, then?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Wow. This picture is weird.
I hate pictures like this... Quincy This is art. QuincyYeah, that's right. sorry.
No. I like it because it's graceful and funny when it's this strange. Quincy Hmmm. I don't understand grace. Quincy No. I like it because it's interesting.
Shall we go inside, then?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Wow. This statue looks like a robot.
Yeah, great work. Quincy is a kid after all. Quincy I like the guy next door.
right. Just like what I saw on TV. I'm sorry I'm a Quincy kid. Quincy, you look like an evil robot...
Shall we go inside, then?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Is this a picture of a famous person?
You're good at it. Quincy I'm a fan. Didn't like QuincyGargantua?
yes. It sure is good. But I don't know this graceful person. Quincy I've never seen the person in this picture on TV, but he's so famous. Quincy Yeah. Yumi is better in manga.
You're misunderstanding something.
Shall we go inside, then?
I agree. Shall we go inside?
I've seen this before.
I've seen this before.
I've seen this before.
Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The ball doesn't roll straight.
Should I fix my form? Quincy Gargantua definitely can't. Quincy What should I do...?
I don't know how graceful it is, so tell me. QuincyNothing like that. You can be graceful. I don't know Quincy Yumi.
Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Look, Yumi, you got a strike.
It's the first one. Quincy hook. It doesn't make sense if you don't have three in a row. Quincy stepped on the foul line just now.
Yumi, I'm going to bang bang from now on. Quincy What do you think of yourself? Quincy Huh? What's that? I don't know grace.
Oops. I can't say it back.
Ah, it's time to start the show. Hurry up, hurry up.
I agree. Let's go in early.
Yumi's seat is... erm.
Look, Gargantua, over here.
Did you like the concert? The Quincy concert was boring, wasn't it? The Quincy concert was so-so, wasn't it?
yes. Graceful awsome. Quincy Yumi was in high spirits. I like Quincy grace though.
Huh. It was boring. Quincy Yeah. Grace is also Sansei. Quincy Grace was boring.
Yumi, the image was a little thin. I didn't think Quincy Grace was that bad. Quincy grace agrees.
Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The zoo seems to have lots of pets, so it's fun.
You can also see rare animals. Aren't you a Quincy kid? QuincyYeah, it's fun.
yes. She loves graceful, rare animals. Quincy Yumi is a child anyway. Quincy Let's go see some animals.
Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
After looking at so many things, Yumi got tired.
Then take a break. Quincy It's still early to get tired. Can Quincy work a little harder?
No. It's okay. Grace is fine, fine. Quincy Uh. It's a mess. Quincy Yeah. I'm still fine.
Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
The koala I just saw was so cute.
For real. Cute, isn't it? Quincy is so cute! Even Quincy has scary eyes.
Yumi, I want a stuffed koala bear. QuincyNothing like that. Quincy Grace, I don't know.
It was really fun. Please invite me again.
Well then, I will contact you next time.

That was good.
I'm tired today.
oh yeah...
I wish I was home.
‥‥‥‥. (Did I make you angry?)
Thank you for your time today.
If it's okay with me, I'll be with you anytime.
I'm pretty sure I was here before. It's boring.
Is that so? (Oops, I should have checked more.)
Come to think of it, I couldn't read the anthology I got at the school festival...
I'm glad you just tried to read it. Thank you.
Come to think of it, the anthology I received at the school festival is, after all, difficult.
You read it. Thank you.
Come to think of it, the anthology I received at the school festival is, after all, difficult.
You read it. Thank you.
Wow. It's lively.
Well then, let's go get a treasure or play a ring toss.
Treasure, treasure. Gamba! Gamba!
If I get it, I'll give it to Gargantua.
yes. Thank you.
Wow, good! I can't help but be graceful.
Awesome!
I'm sorry. I wanted that doll...
Wow, they are all beautiful!
Let's compete with Yumi this time.

Termaya. It's a beautiful firework.
Rising Dragon Turbulence Shichihenge is that guy. Quincy sparklers are better. QuincyIt's really beautiful.
Awesome. You can say that name well. Graceful, my tongue won't turn. Quincy Yumi would be nice to have a big one in the night sky. Quincy Yumi also wants to launch fireworks.
Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Let's go inside.
Go to the video game corner. Go to the Quincy medal game corner.
Yumi is a girl, but she likes arcades.
don't mind. Will Quincy go bad? Quincy Recently, a lot of girls have come.
It makes me so happy to hear you say that. QuincyNothing like that. She's a beautiful girl. Quincy Yeah. I have a lot of friends I met at the Yumi game arcade.
which game should i play?
It's shooting. I think Quincy puzzles are interesting. How about a Quincy crane game?
After all, it's a crunchy side shoe. I don't do Quincy graceful puzzles and quizzes because I'm not good at them. Quincy, I think I'll give it a shot.
The medal corner feels like an adult.
I'm pretty popular with girls. Quincy Then you should go home. Quincy I'm not gambling money.
Yumi, I collect medals from various places. Please don't treat Quincy Yumi like a child. QuincyThat's obvious.
Let's play a horse racing game.
what about blackjack? Quincy Hanafuda is good. Quincy Slots Better?
yes. That one is more graceful. Quincy graceful I don't know. Quincy slot would be nice too.
Gargantua hasn't come yet.
Would you like to wait a little longer?

Let's go in quickly.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What kind of song should I sing?
Definitely Anison. Quincy is enka after all. How about the Quincy game theme song?
Then I love grace too. Quincy Grace, it's no good to be damp. QuincyIs there such a thing?
In a place like this, I also like to talk gracefully.

A park like this isn't bad either.

Did you enjoy today's movie? QuincyThat movie was boring, wasn't it? QuincyThe movie was okay, wasn't it?
Yes, it was beautiful. Quincy Soo. Grace was fun though. Quincy Hmmm. Grace was fun though.
Yumi really likes anime. Quincy isn't Yumi's hobby. I didn't really understand Quincy Grace.
Grace is so-so. I didn't think Quincy Grace was that bad. Quincy Yumi thinks so too.
that? There are a lot of people, but what is it?
Come to think of it, there should be a parade today.
Invite them to watch the parade. Quincy pretends not to know and goes home.
Wow, beautiful. I wonder if Yumi will march with me.
No matter how many times I see it, it's beautiful.
I'm glad you seemed to like it.
It's a pool, it's a pool Wow, wow.
Shall we go inside?
That swimsuit is sexy. Quincy, that swimsuit is cute. Quincy doesn't look good.

I agree. Let's go inside.
Wow, beautiful. Let's sit over there.
Stars are beautiful.
It's a glow from hundreds of millions of years ago. Quincy It's just a light. QuincyYes, I think so.
I wonder if it was around the time of a graceful, great-great-great-great-great-grandfather. Quincy I don't think it's just light leaking out of a hole in the sky. QuincyThat's right.

Where is it? Don't explain it with a Quincy tape. Quincy I think it's Cygnus.
Oh. Just like Yumi, I don't know. Quincy. Don't you know? Quincy was in Cygnus after all.

Shall we go in, then?
I agree. Let's go inside.
Flowers are beautiful, but they don't move.
But when I look at the flowers, my heart softens. I wonder if I can eat Quincy. QuincyThis is a beautiful flower.
yes. Calm down. Quincy Grace, I hate vegetables. Quincy, but graceful is prettier, isn't it?
Shall we go in, then?
I agree. Let's go inside.
Even the elegant rooms are decorated with flowers.
Really nice. Quincy Shall we bring the flowers here too? Even in Quincy, flowers are expensive.
yes. Quincy, don't do that. Quincy is fine. Even in the garden of the house It's a flower that is blooming.
So where shall we go shopping?
Let's go see clothes. Let's go see some Quincy accessories. Let's go to the Quincy junk shop.
Are you bargaining something? Quincy Yeah. Let's go quickly. Quincy, junk shop? There's nothing that graceful wants.
Yumi: Ever since I was little, I've always had hand-me-downs from my brother, so I don't buy a lot of clothes.
Then it was just right. Is Quincy really a girl? Quincy Poor it?
Yes, thank you. Come on, let's take a look. QuincyEh, it's terrible. I will cry gracefully. Quincy No. okay. Yumi, I also liked boys' clothes quite a bit.
Grace, I shopped too much.
Here, I'll bring it. I'm tired of hanging out with Quincy. Quincy bought this much...
uh, can you bring it? Well then, this and this, please. I'm sorry Quincy. Grace, I will reflect. Even Quincy had fun.
Uhi. bush snake
Isn't this cute?
Yeah, it looks great on Gargantua. Quincy I don't think so. Quincy is pretty cute too.
yes? I'm happy to be graceful too. Quincy teasing. I wish I could tell you that you look good even if it's a lie. Quincy Oh, it's true. I'm lost in grace.
There's a lot going on, so don't get lost. Which one looks nice?
How about this silver necklace? Quincy How about this copper necklace? Quincy How about this gold necklace?
Silver huh? Cool. Quincy grace, no copper. Quincy Hmmm. I want one, but I can't buy it with my graceful pocket money.
I don't like it here.
Shall we go home then? QuincyIt's cool with a cyber vibe. Quincy It's okay. It's not dangerous.
Let's do so. Hurry up, hurry up. It doesn't have to be Quincy Cyber. I want to go home early. Quincy really. Is it okay if I touch you?
I'm here again.
sorry. It'll be over soon. Quincy has a lot more to offer, though. Quincy must come more often...
Yeah, that's fine. Grace, I'll wait patiently. Quincy I can't imagine anything better than this. Quincy grace, please refrain.
Skating, skating is fun.
Shall we go inside?
Grace is invincible on ice.
It's weird to be on ice. Quincy I'm invincible Quincy tell me
Heheen. You're no match for this Grace on ice. Quincy is definitely more invincible than grace. Quincy Yumi's tuition is a little expensive.
Skating, skating is fun.
Shall we go inside?
Oh, the ice is melting here. It's hard when you fall.
I will support you. Quincy will fall. surely. Quincy I didn't bring a change of clothes.
Beautiful, happy. Quincy Grace, don't fall. Quincy grace is fine.
It's skiing, it's skiing. Slide fast.
Let's do so.
How far can you ski?
If you want to ski, leave it to me. Quincy sleds have confidence though. Quincy I can skate for now.
All right, then I'll take the advanced course with Yumi. Quincy Eh, I can't help it. Let's go to the beginner's course. Quincy Well then, let's go to the intermediate course.
It's skiing, it's skiing. Slide fast.
Let's do so.
This elegant ski wear is cool, isn't it?
Like a pro skier. Quincy doesn't suit me at all. Quincy looks good and cute.
Ehehe. Graceful, I'm tired. Quincy Eh. Terrible. Quincy Hmmm, maybe I didn't look like an adult.
See you soon.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Is baseball interesting?
i really like it... Quincy is not funny at all. What about Quincy Gargantua?
yes. Yumi also likes Dai. Quincy Ahh, that's not true. I love Quincy Grace.
See you soon.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
Grace, I don't really know the rules. It tells us.
I don't know either. Quincy I won't tell you. Quincy That's right (explains).

It's professional wrestling. wow wow.
I'll be in soon. Gargantua.
Wrestling is on fire.
It's going to be flaming. Quincy Even Quincy looks painful.
Let's play professional wrestling with Yumi next time. Quincy If you say that, I'll decide on the graceful suspended ceiling. Quincy is trained, so don't worry, don't worry.
It's professional wrestling. wow wow.
I'll be in soon. Gargantua.
Do you think professional wrestling is barbaric?
It's a sacred sport. Quincy barbaric. QuincyI think so, but I like it.
Yumi, I love professional wrestling. Quincy Grace, I don't think so. Quincy In time, you'll get used to it.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go inside.
Wow. There are many beautiful fish.
Really beautiful. Quincy looks delicious. Quincy Art in the water.
Such a beautiful fish, I want to keep Yumi too. Quincy, even though I was looking at a beautiful fish... Quincy Yeah. That's how it feels.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go inside.
Yumi wants to be a mermaid too.
I'm sure someday I'll be able to. QuincyHey, isn't that weird? I wish I could be Quincy.
At that time, play the role of the prince. Quincy Grace, it's not funny. Quincy Yeah. I'll do my best.
Let's go inside.
I agree. Let's go inside.
The dolphin show I just saw. It was interesting.
Dolphins are mammals. Quincy dolphins are smart. Aren't Quincy dolphin teeth scary?
Huh, that's right. Graceful, I didn't know. Knowledgeable. Quincy Yumi is stupid anyway. Quincy Yumi forgives Iruka-san because he's cute.
I didn't mean to.
This is the library.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
It's quiet in the library.
Oh! Everyone is studying! Quincy let's be quiet too Quincy It's true, it's quiet.
Really. It's amazing to come to the library and study. Quincy Grace, I'm not good at keeping quiet. It's hard. Yumi Quincy, you're reading manga.
- Please keep quiet in the librarian library.
Hehehe. I was offended.
This is the library.
I agree. Shall we go inside?
What kind of book did you come to read?
Do you have manga? Quincy I'm looking for this literary book. QuincyNo, not really.
Then let's go to the bookstore. Quincy Let's read manga together instead of such a difficult book. Quincy Well, let's find manga.
Yay, it's an amusement park.
Shall we go inside?
Ah, there's a hero show over there.
Invite Gargantua to go see it. Ignore the Quincy show at all.
Gargantua, do you want to go see the hero show?
Are you doing a hero show? let's go, let's go
A hero show is on fire.
Already. It will burn great. Do you mind the eyes of Quincy people? Quincy Don't be shy.
Same with grace. Quincy grace, as long as it's fun, that's fine. QuincyYes. that's right.
People who wear stuffed animals, It looks like it's going to be hard.
It's easier than shooting. I've never worn Quincy before... I've heard that Quincy is tough.
Huh. Is it different from shooting? Even if you've never worn Quincy, graceful, I know. Quincy Yumi, I just want to try it on.
Gargantua, what do you want to ride?
Which should I do?
Let's ride a roller coaster. Let's go to the Quincy ghost house. Let's ride the Quincy Ferris wheel.
Yumi, I love this so much.
Let's ride then.
It was a thrill.
I was a little scared With that Quincy? It's not funny. QuincyIt sure was amazing.
When you're scared, leave it to grace. Quincy Uh. Graceful, not funny. Even in Quincy, this thrill is irresistible to grace.
No matter how many times I ride, Kai Khan.
But are you tired? Quincy ok, let's ride until we get tired. QuincyI really like you.
yes. I definitely want to ride another. Quincy Hmmm. But, I want to ride another. QuincyYes. But I like others too.
Yumi, it's okay to be a ghost.
yes. Shall we go in, then?
It was more amazing than I thought.
It was okay because I was there. With that Quincy? Isn't it funny? Quincy Gargantua, you're a coward.
yes. Grace, I wasn't afraid. Quincy graceful isn't crazy. Quincy sometimes.
Ghost houses are dark. I couldn't see well.

I was just looking at Gargantua's face... QuincyAh, I was sleepy. QuincyYeah, it was a nice view.
Ehehe. I'm glad. Quincy graceful, boring. QuincySpeaking of which, I saw a cake shop.
Wasn't it scary to shake at a high place?
I'm fine with Gargantua. It might be the scariest ride in Quincy Park. Quincy shaking? I didn't notice it at all.
sorry. The fact that it shook is graceful. Ehehe. QuincyNo way. There are a lot of things that are more amazing than google. Quincy That's fine.
Gargantua, what do you want to ride?

Ahaha, interesting. Quincy I don't think so. Quincy Yeah. I think grace is in three fingers.
Vivir's popularity is amazing.
Gargantua is also very popular. Quincy Waiting in line is painful. It might be the most popular ride in Quincy Park.
Ehehe. I'm happy even if you compliment me gracefully. Quincy Grace, if it's fun, it's not as painful as waiting. Quincy Yumi thinks so too.
Yumi, it's okay to be a ghost.

It really feels like you're traveling in space.
When the meteor came, I was terrified. Quincy is childish after all. Quincy was amazing.
Even Yumi was surprised. Look, it was crisp. Dear Quincy, Yumi is still a child. Quincy is a virtual ship.
Giji Taiken is tough.
It's hard to make. QuincyI don't think so. QuincyI think so.
I can't imagine a graceful Tsumu, but it's amazing. Quincy Well, that's not true. It's really hard. Also known as Quincy virtual reality. I don't understand.

Guru Guru means a Ferris wheel?
Let's take a walk somewhere around there.
Let's go to the tree-lined street today.
yes. let's go
Yumi, I don't like quiet places like this.
A walk will make you hungry. It's like a scene from a Quincy romance novel. QuincyThat's right. I'm not good at it
yes. Yumi is also hungry. Let's go get something to eat. QuincyIt's not like a senior to say something like that. Quincy Yeah. Graceful, yes.
Let's take a walk somewhere around there.
Let's go to the pond today.
yes. let's go
It's a beautiful pond. Are there no fish?
Oh, there's a carp over there. Quincy Let's take a rest. A Quincy ghost might appear.
Eh, where? Wow. Really. Quincy is fine. Yumi I'm not tired. I wish it was Quincy. Yumi, I want to meet a ghost once.
Wow. It's full of cherry blossoms.
Alright, let's go cherry blossom viewing.
yes. let's go, let's go
It's already in full bloom. Cherry blossoms will fall soon.
That's why it's beautiful. Quincy Because that's the law of nature. Quincy roads get dirty.
Once in a while, it's not bad to be a centimeter. Quincy I want you to have romance once in a while. QuincyIn that case, Yumi will clean it for you. Ahahahaha.
Yo.
What is it, Yoshio?
Shall we go home then?
That's right, do you want to go home?
Isn't even Yoshio there?
Did Yoshio go home with Gargantua?
It can't be helped, should I go home alone?
Oh, I was tired.
Ha... What is it, Yoshio?
What's wrong, I'm not feeling well It's like an empty shell.
Is it a shell... Yes, that's exactly how I feel.
all right. You were dumped
Ugh!
It's like a figure star. Who did you confess to? tell me
It would be nice to have something like that...
Well, okay. But only my best friend can heal that wound in my heart.
I'm happy about that feeling, but I'll talk about it when my heart is sorted out.
That's right. Well then, let's go home together, lonely people.
Ah, Yoshio! Let's go home now.
sorry. I'm going home with Mio. See you.
sorry. I'm going home with Yuna. See you.
sorry. I'm going home with Ayako. See you.
sorry. I'm going home with Saki. See you.
sorry. I'm going home with Yukari. See you.
sorry. I will return with hope. See you.
sorry. I'm going home with Mira. See you.
sorry. I'm going home with Yuko. See you.
sorry. I'll go home with love See you.
you're right. I know, but somehow I'm lonely...
It can't be helped, are you going home alone?
I'm happy about that feeling, but I'll talk about it when my heart is sorted out. Let's go home now.
Ah, Gargantua...
I was wondering why you called me to a place like this.
Before I graduate, I really have something I want to say, how should I say it...
What do you mean?
Up until now, the most fun I've had is going to various trendy places and having fun.
What can I say, lately I feel like I've gotten tired of that too.
After all, if you're with someone you love, you don't have to go anywhere to have fun. I still think so now.
Hmm, I'm tired.
I'm already an idiot. I'm saying I enjoy being with you.
Well, that's...
It's super embarrassing, but... I think I've fallen in love with you.
I don't need anything else if only you were here. I don't care what's popular.
So hang out with me
Actually, I'm also talking about Gargantua...
Very happy. But after all, it's more fun to go out and play somewhere than just to be together.
That's right.
Let's go on a trip after we graduate.
Oh, okay
Well then, let's go to the travel agency. Hurry up, hurry up.
It doesn't change at all, but okay.
And Shiori...
sorry. I called you to a place like this, and there's something I really want to say to you today...
What do you mean?
I've never dated a boy before...
But that doesn't mean I wasn't interested.
Even I wanted to date a boy, and I've received many love letters.
But I just didn't feel like dating.
Why?
You..., because you were by my side...
Until now, I thought you were just a childhood friend...
No, I'm sure you're afraid that you will realize my true feelings, so maybe I thought so.
But now that I'm graduating... I might be separated.
I feel embarrassed and want to run away, but I don't want to be just a childhood friend anymore...
As a single girl, I want you to look only at me, so I muster up the courage to say this.
I like it…. I love you more than anyone else in the world...
To tell the truth…. I'm also talking about Shiori...
Oh, that...? I should have been happy, but tears came out.
Really, really, believe me.
sure. I love you, Shiori.
happy…. Never let go of me...
Phew, the graduation ceremony is over. The principal's story is too long.
Kisaragi-san, didn't you collapse from anemia?
Hi, Gargantua….
I was waiting... House…. I'm sorry. Call me to a place like this...
What's wrong? It's not like Gargantua.
It's okay. Starting today, I decided to change...
e? change?
Yes, it will change.
Up until now, I've been drowning in my own talent and looking down on people.
She was a very ugly girl, no matter who looked at her.
I made fun of ordinary girls making noise about love.
But since when
For the first time in my life, I feel... I knew right away that I was in love with you.
But I'm the woman who sold her soul to the devil called science.
In order to suppress such floating emotions, I immersed myself in research.
But as graduation approaches,
That feeling is getting stronger, and I can't control myself...
That's why I challenged you to completely deny that feeling.
Needless to say, I know the result...
I lost to you in everything.
I don't want to think about being hated by you anymore.
I will abandon my ambitions for world domination. 'Cause my ambition is
Because I changed to be liked by you...
To tell the truth…. I'm also concerned about Himo-san...
Ho, really...? So your ambition has been fulfilled...
I'm happy….
Even if I conquered the world, I don't think I would have been this happy...
I'm happy too
I'll do my best to become a girl that you like.
eh? Who are you? did you see it somewhere?
I... This is Ijuin.
Did you have a sister in Ijuin?
House. Rei Ijuin is herself.
eh?
sorry. Until now I…. I pretended to be a man and lied...
Great lie.
In the Ijuin family, girls have to live as boys outside the house until they graduate from high school.
It looks like a cartoon...
But I... There was only one day left, but I just couldn't stand it...
I'm sorry for calling you to a place like this.
ok ok Separately….
I'm sorry that I always hate you.
But the reason I've been hated and slapped up until now is because I was trying to make you hate me.
I thought that if I hated you, I would be able to forget about you...
But you always called me,
Even though I said such terrible things, over and over again...
I was so happy that I was always crying on the other side of the phone...
Later, when I was kidnapped, you probably came to the abandoned factory.
I was very happy that you were worried about me like this.
I've always lived a tough life, but... but I'm just a normal girl.
I always wanted to be with everyone, chatting and going out.
Even on Valentine's Day, to you...
I can do that from tomorrow, but before I graduate, I wanted you to see the real me...
I don't care about the Ijuin family anymore. So... I like it.
I'm sorry for lying to you all this time. But please stay with me.
Ijuin…. No, Mr. Ijuin...
I think it's annoying... let me know how you feel If you have to give up then...
Thinking so far, There's no way I can refuse.
Well, then...
of course. it's ok
I… I…. what should i say...
You've finally become a normal girl...
Can I ask you just one thing?
What?
About when Yoshio collapsed...
I'm sorry...
Yoshio-kun found out that I was a girl, so I manipulated my memory.
That's what it was after all...
Do you despise me...
no…. Because I know that feeling...
Thank you…. You're really kind... I'm glad I fell in love with you...
Or Katagiri-san...
Oh, so, sorry. waited? sorry. Call me to a place like this.
no problem. What do you want?
that…
I want to ask you one thing... Do you dislike girls with rough personalities?
No, I like it, but... that's all?
Wait, wait a minute. The real use is from now on.
There's something I really want to say to you...
I'm easy to get along with and talk to anyone, so it may not have seemed that way to me...
I felt most relaxed when I was talking to you.
Now, I finally realized that
If I thought that I might not be able to meet you after graduating like this,
I suddenly became sad and didn't know what to do...
I'm a sloppy personality, but I thought about this one seriously. So I made up my mind.
It's really embarrassing for a girl to say.
want you to hear my true feelings... I just want you to listen.
………….
I miss you. I'm lonely without you...
So..., so with me...
I told you earlier that I love you.
It's actually Gargantua.
‥‥‥‥. very…?
You can't tell a joke at a time like this.
Unbelievable. can't believe it….
Today is the happiest day since I was born. Eye Never Forget.
will never forget
Or Gargantua….
I'm sorry for calling you to a place like this.
Suddenly. Gargantua apologized...
Oh, don't be so surprised... But it's okay. listen to me
………….
I moved to this town when I was in middle school.
In the last town, I... was dumped by a boy many times...
So when you come to this town, let's be reborn.
I thought I'd be the most attractive woman and look back at the boys.
Her hard work paid off, and she became a woman who caught the attention of boys.
And I've been deliberately arrogant to take revenge on the boys.
That's right...
It was fun at first... I was happy to be liked by boys...
But that didn't satisfy my heart.
It's obvious. Lying to yourself and living, The heart can't be fulfilled.
If I hadn't met you, I might not have thought of this...
When I got to know you, I thought I could throw away my current self with this person.
But at that time, I didn't have the courage to throw myself away.
I didn't want to go back to my old self...
But now I'm finally brave enough.
I can't stand graduating while you think I'm that kind of woman.
More than dozens of men, I just want you to be by my side.
Because you're the only one who can heal my wounds...
i like it Stay by my side forever... please….
Oh I see….
After all, I can't do it.
If it's okay with me...
Really? happy…. I can finally regain my true self.
But other boys seem to hate me.
All right. The one I chose. No one should complain.
I hope so. I'm a little worried...
You, Gargantua….
excuse me. I thought it was rude, but...
There is something I must say to you today, so I summoned you here.
no problem. What do you mean?
Perhaps because I was physically weak, I didn't have many friends.
My only hobby is reading books.
And every time I read a book, I yearn for the love in it,
I feel sorry for myself for being a little jealous,
My cowardly self, who can't confess my true feelings, keeps pissing me off...
But from today onwards, I'm going to change myself.
Why?
Until now, I have encountered many books and left them in my memories.
But I don't want my high school life, when I met you, to be nothing but memories...
I don't want it to be just a fantasy, like a novel...
I summon the courage of my life to say this.
I like it.
We can be friends, not lovers. Even after I graduated, if I could see you all the time...
To tell the truth…. I'm also talking about Gargantua...
ho, is that true...
Is it really okay for me to be like this...?
sure. I love you, Gargantua.
I'm happy….
Ah.
Ah, it's dangerous. Gargantua.
Ufufufufu... It's good that your body is weak.
This is how I can get you to hold me.
Please stay like this for a while...
Come on, Gargantua. that? what happened to your glasses?
I thought that this one would suit my taste better, so I took the plunge and decided to use contacts.
Maybe for me...
excuse me. I thought it was rude, but...
There is something I must say to you today, so I summoned you here.
no problem. What do you mean?
Perhaps because I was physically weak, I didn't have many friends.
My only hobby is reading books.
And every time I read a book, I yearn for the love in it,
I feel sorry for myself for being a little jealous,
My cowardly self, who can't confess my true feelings, keeps pissing me off...
But from today onwards, I'm going to change myself.
Why?
Until now, I have encountered many books and left them in my memories.
But I don't want my high school life, when I met you, to be nothing but memories...
I don't want it to be just a fantasy, like a novel...

I like it.
We can be friends, not lovers. Even after I graduated, if I could see you all the time...
To tell the truth…. I'm also talking about Gargantua...
ho, is that true...
Is it really okay for me to be like this...?
sure. I love you, Gargantua.
I'm happy….
Ah.
Ah, it's dangerous. Gargantua.
Ufufufufu... It's good that your body is weak.
This is how I can get you to hold me.
Please stay like this for a while...
This, Gargantua….
I know it's rude, but there's something I really want to talk to you about, so I called you. I'm sorry.
Even if it's not that unbearable...
No. I don't mean that. It's the most important business of my life.
What's important?
I always like not to think about anything, but lately, I spend more time thinking about various things than I do during that time.
what's on your mind?
It's an embarrassing story, but I can't get you out of my head... Even when I'm at home, I think about you all the time and forget about the passage of time.
I was more dazed than usual, so my mother asked me why. When I told him about it honestly, he told me to tell him my true feelings under this tree on the day of the graduation ceremony. Therefore, I would like you to listen to my true feelings without laughing.
No.
I always think only of you. The only place where I can stay calm is by your side. If it's okay with me, I'd like you to keep in touch with me from now on, even after I graduate.
Actually, I'm also talking about Gargantua...
really? Was good. Do as your mother says... Well then, could you meet my father tomorrow?
Oh, to Gargantua's father?
yes. My father has told me to bring the gentlemen who associate with me to the house.
Oh yeah. Well then, let's go.
Is that so. I'm sure your father will like it too.
Oh yeah. (Suddenly, Dad...)
You, Gargantua….
sorry. Call me to a place like this.
no problem. what happened?
I'm graduating today, so there's something I really want to talk to you about... It's okay to just listen...
yes…. Listen.
Until now, I've only been swimming, and I haven't had time to talk about love or romance.
All the boys were poor, and none of them interested me, so I didn't even think about it until now...
I don't remember when, but... I'm worried about your existence,
I can't get myself into practice... Recently, my heart is pounding so much that I can't sleep at night...
I've been told I'm masculine, but I didn't care,
I don't want you to think so.
That's why I've been careful not to speak manly words in front of you, even my actions...
If this doesn't work, I'll give up swimming too. I'll grow your hair as long as you want.
I'm sorry... I said something selfish... But it's okay to say no.
I just don't want to graduate with this feeling, so just listen to my feelings.
No….
i like it... I can't even sleep at night...
………….
That's right. After all, I'm no good.
But I'm sorry I said that. Thank you for listening.
Come on, Gargantua. wait.
Don't hold me back. If you stop me, I'm going to expect it. It's not miserable if words of comfort are applied.
Gargantua. I like it too
eh? What now...?
I said I like Gargantua too.
Huh, really? For someone like me who has nothing but swimming...
sure.
No, no. I can't stop crying anymore...
please. let me cry in your chest
OK.
happy. I'm so happy...
You, Gargantua….
sorry. Call me to a place like this.
no problem. what happened?
I'm graduating today, so there's something I really want to talk to you about... It's okay to just listen...
yes…. Listen.
Until now, I've only been swimming, and I haven't had time to talk about love or romance.
All the boys were poor, and none of them interested me, so I didn't even think about it until now...
I don't remember when, but... I'm worried about your existence,
I can't get myself into practice... Recently, my heart is pounding so much that I can't sleep at night...
Even though I've been told I'm manly, I didn't care, but I don't want you to think so.
That's why I've been careful not to speak manly words in front of you, even my actions...
If this doesn't work, I'll give up swimming too. Transform into the woman you want.
I'm sorry... I said something selfish... But it's okay to say no.
I just don't want to graduate feeling like this, so just listen to my feelings.
No….
i like it... I can't even sleep at night...
………….
That's right. After all, I'm no good.
But I'm sorry I said that. Thank you for listening.
Come on, Gargantua. wait.
Don't hold me back. If you hold me back, I'll be expecting you.
It's not miserable if words of comfort are applied.
Gargantua. I like it too
eh? What now...?
I said I like Gargantua too.
Huh, really? For someone like me who has nothing but swimming...
sure.
No, no. I can't stop crying anymore...
please. let me cry in your chest
OK.
happy. I'm so happy...
Gargantua….
that…. I'm sorry. Call me to a place like this...
no problem. By the way, what?
that…. ………….
what happened?
No, no... After all, it's embarrassing...
 Are you so embarrassed?
Yes... But, if you don't show up your courage today, you'll regret it for the rest of your life...
I have a lot to say, but... Now that I say it, I feel like I can't say the most important thing...
So... I'll just say the most important thing...
Oh you... I like you…. It's embarrassing...
Oh wait. Gargantua.
No. I can't stay here
I like Gargantua too.
eh…. really…? I'm glad I confessed under this tree...
Gargantua also knew the legend...
Yes... but. Even a lie was fine.
If I rely on the legend of this tree, I'm sure I'll have the courage to confess... It was really good….
I'm also happy to be confessed to by Gargantua.
Our love is now forever...
Nijino-san...
I'm sorry. Even though you're busy, you called me to a place like this...
No, that's fine. I'm not busy.
I had something I really wanted to tell you, so I sent you that letter.
could have told you everything in a letter, but I wanted to tell you my feelings directly...
oh yeah...
You don't know, but I was always watching you.
And I'm gradually attracted to that figure that works hard at everything...
When I am troubled or in pain, I am always encouraged by your single-minded efforts.
I got through it no matter what. That's why I think I can show courage today.
‥‥‥‥.
I can't do anything else except cooking...
It may be a nuisance to you, but I can't lie to myself anymore.
At this point, let me be clear.
I like you. I want to support you all the time...
Actually, me too, Mr. Nijino...
I'm glad I took the courage... After all, if you do your best, you can do anything.
That's right. Tomorrow... I want to have a graduation party with just the two of us...
will you come
of course. gladly.
Then tell me your favorite dish. I'm waiting for you to make a lot tomorrow.
There's a letter on your desk. From whom?
What... "I'll be waiting for you under the legendary tree."
Quincy going under the legendary tree No, I've got someone I've made up my mind to Quincy It's none of my business
Well then, I have to hurry.
That's right, in order not to waste these three years, I have to confess to that girl...
All right, I'll tell Gargantua my thoughts.
I'm not here...
I'm not here either...
Not even here... Where the hell are you?
couldn't find it after all... Are you going to graduate with regrets?
Oh, I was there! And I'm alone! Chance!
Ah, Gargantua!
Where is Gargantua? Maybe that letter... OK, let's go!
Yoshio seems to have returned with Gargantua. Then go home alone?
Now, let's go confess to the girl! Quincy Well, I guess I'll go home...
Yu, Gargantua….
I'm sorry. I was called to a place like this...
No, I don't mind.
you know what. Graceful. I always wanted to be in the same grade as my seniors.
If we were in the same grade, we could have been together for three years in high school, and even went on a school trip together...
I wonder why grace wasn't born when my brother was born... I cried many times.
Graceful. I think she's childish and selfish compared to a girl in her senior year.
But if I don't like being childish, I'll try to be more mature. I will fix my selfishness.
So, don't treat me as your brother's little sister, but as a girl.
Because I love my seniors more than anyone else in the world, and I can't help but love them...
Actually. Me too, Gargantua...
is that true? Can I be younger than you?
Of course. I love you, Gargantua.
Then, please give me the second button of the uniform.
OK. yes.
Wow. With this as a talisman, I will do my best for another year.
Even after graduating, please come visit my house not just to see your brother, but to meet Yumi.
Otherwise, I'll cry because I'm gracefully lonely.
yes. I will definitely go.
happy. I love it. upperclassman.
But if he gets married, will he become Yoshio's younger brother?
-? ? ? Excuse me.
that? The Ijuin family, erm...
My name is Yukinojo Sotoi.
In Ijuin, in the classroom...
No…. Actually, I have something for you...
eh? to me?

- Stop Ijuin, Sotoi!
Le, Ray...
After all, it is an unrequited love... I know how you feel, but don't give up...
> Sotoi.....
My sotoi was rude. Forget about today.
Okay, but...
Sotoi. I'm going home.
Yes... Excuse me then.
Excuse me then.
I was surprised. Sure enough, Sotoi...
Ah, you...
I'm sorry until now. My name is Miharu Tatebayashi.
I summoned you here because I really wanted to say something to you...
What do you mean?
It wasn't a coincidence that I bumped into you until now.

Excuse me.
that?
Gargantua. I'm angry for something
>Teacher, Pantagruelle, I've been waiting for you.
Hey, I got called by the teacher.
・ ・ ・
Finally, the teacher's errands are over. Gargantua seems to be gone.
excuse me.
that? Gargantua.
Oh, were you in the staff room?
You must have been angry now.
eh. My cousin, I was seen.
What were you angry about?
Wait a minute, I'm late...
So, being scolded like that is quite a habitual offender.
That's not true. Maybe 3 or 4 times a week.
They call it a habitual offender.
But I was able to be late just by putting up with it. It's cheap.
Ha... There is no color of reflection...
Well then, I'm in a hurry.
Ah, a new stuffed animal.
Crane game prize? OK, can I take it?
Let me do it a little earlier.
oh ok
・ ・ ・
Uh, good.
copper? Actually, let's do it.
That's amazing. (I'm glad I didn't.)
yes. You can do it next time.
Even if it's next, there's nothing left but the weird one.
Well, yes. Let's play another game.
Oh, okay
Before that, I'll get you a bag.
yeah yeah
I'm doing a parade. Come on, let's go see it.
Oh, wait Gargantua.
No matter how many times I see it, it's so beautiful.
Really beautiful.
I've seen this parade many times, but... today is the most beautiful
Why?
mean, at last my wish came true, anyway.
wish?
For a long time, I wanted to see you with someone I love.
eh? I couldn't hear you very well. Say it again
Hey, hey, let's watch quietly. It's over.
Be quiet... (What did you say?)
Somehow, it feels like the dawn has come. oh ok
Wow.
Oh. I was surprised.
Kyaa, taisei, super cool.
Wow, this is amazing.
It's already the best.
So let's keep quiet for a while.
・ ・ ・
What are you doing alone?
I thought it was amazing...
Come on, together. Stand up, stand up
Yes.
The ice melts and it's soggy. Gargantua, watch out...
Ahh.
Ah, from what I said.
It's cold.
Come on, get up.
Thank you.
It's terrible. Even my pants are soaked.
eh? Pants…?
Come on. I can't go anywhere until this dries up.
This skate rink seems to have a drying room.
really? Ah, then, let's go for a while.
Ah, Gargantua. is fast...
Shall we go inside, then?
yes. Just a little patience.
eh? , hold on, what are you doing...
Come on, let's do it quickly.
what?
If you come to the library and say what you do, it's not just one thing.
...?
Eh, didn't you come here today to make a competition?
Compe is the test from tomorrow?
that's right. It's decided.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Gargantua, do you always make campes?
It's natural. So here, here, here, please.
・ ・ ・
Ahh, it was painful. I'm typophobic.
Do you have that kind of disease?
But now the exam is super easy.
On the other hand, it seems that the results are not very good.
It's suddenly raining. I'm glad I brought an umbrella. Ah, there's Shiori.
Hey Shiori. what happened?
It suddenly started to rain, and the weather forecast said it wouldn't rain.
Didn't you bring an umbrella?
yes….
If you don't mind, would you like to come in with me?
Um, did you bring an umbrella?
Of course. Because it's good for your daily routine.
It must have rained then. Ufufufufufu.
Besides, I don't have to go home with you, but...
Oh, just kidding. Together... I want to go home.
yes? Well then, let's go.
After all, it's a little embarrassing.
I'm so happy to be able to share an umbrella with Shiori.
Will my lovers see me...?
Shiori and I are the moon and the turtle, so I'm sure you won't be able to see it.
Well, I don't think so...
uh, right? I'd be happy if that was the case, but...
Hey, why don't we go to the park for a minute?
Oh, oh, that's fine
Even if it's just a little longer, I'm happy...
Sometimes it's nice to wake up early.
Ah, Pantagruelle
good morning. It's early today.
Good morning, Shiori. Sometimes I wake up early.
I enjoyed going to school today. I've often said that getting up early is worth the money.
It's nice to talk in a place like this.
Hey, do you remember
what?
I also just remembered... Definitely this one.
Hey Shiori. where are you going
Oh, there it is.
What happened?
See, do you remember this? About 10 years ago, It's a trace of comparing heights together.
Oh, is that so?
that's right. At that time, my height didn't change much.
I'm taller now.
Back then, we were always playing together, but since when...?
what?
Since when did we stop playing together?
together... I wonder how long...
It's not too late now. Also, like back then...
eh….
ok Because I have nothing else. Let's go home now.
Ah, uh, yeah.
The weather is nice today and it feels good, so why don't we sit on the lawn?
OK.
Oh, come to think of it, isn't this park?
what?
You see, once upon a time, you went to a park far away without telling your father and mother.
I wonder if that happened.
There was I remember it well.
for example?
For example, when I almost fell into a big pond...
in the pond? Ah, I remember. That's me
that's right. I remember it well.
almost fell into the pond and was helped by an uncle I didn't know. I thought I was going to die then. What about Shiori at that time?
I was scared and watched... I think.
It would be nice if you could help me...
It's not enough. It's a fond memory.
Still good though. But it's really nostalgic.
There were many other things. ‥‥‥‥‥‥‥.
agree.
It's pretty empty. Let's ride.
This Ferris wheel seems to have stopped.
Huh, really? What should I do.
It's okay. I'm going to move soon.
yes…. But I'm still scared.
See, you can ride for a long time just because it's stopped, so it must be a good feeling.
Yeah, but...
Or are you with me?
Oh, that kind of thing... Because I...
Ah, it seems to have moved.
Hahahaha... Good for you. (Ferris wheel idiot!!)
Before, I was really scared.
More than that, I want to hear the continuation of what I was about to say earlier.
Eh, I forgot something. That's not good.
Did you forget... I wonder what it is (Well, okay.)
Oh, I can't find Shiori.
I wonder where they went...
Pantagruelle, wow!
That was Shiori's voice. From where…,
! ! !
It was fun.
I was wondering where it went because I couldn't find it.
sorry. I thought I'd be a little surprised.
I was totally surprised.
Ufufufufufu.
Hurry up. what's wrong
remember the surprised face from earlier... Ufufufufufu.
Huh, was that a weird face?
I'm sorry. I laughed...
Apart from that, it's fine...
Come on, let's go swimming.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Huh, Gargantua? what happened?
If you don't mind... would you like to go home with me?
Yeah I'll send it
Party was fun.
I agree. (It would have been better without Ijuin)
Come to think of it, we used to always have Christmas parties together.
agree. When did you become separate?
don't you remember?
When I was in elementary school, who made a promise to a friend for a Christmas party?
…me?
I.
Hey!
Oops, sorry! sorry.
Make fun of people...
Ah…. Hey look!
e?
snow….
Is true….
splendid…. White Christmas...
I have to thank Santa Claus.
Purururururu
Purururururu
Purururururu
That's a phone. who might that be?
Katya
Yes, it's a Pantagruelle.
Ah, my name is Fujisaki...
Oh, Gargantua? what's wrong with you?
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Hey, are you free now?
e? ... but it's empty.
For real? Well then, why don't we celebrate our birthday together?
yep, OK.
Was good…. Have you prepared a cake? Come to my room... won't you come?
all right.
Shiori, let's go in.
yeah, that's fine.
Happy Birthday, Pantagruelle.
Ah... congratulations, Shiori. (How long has it been since you entered Shiori's room?)
what happened?
No…. Ah, Shiori. This is a present.
this is from me.
Thank you. I'll take care of you.
Before, we used to celebrate together like this.
We share the same birthday, so it's like we're twins...
Yeah, that's right.
Ah, yes.
Hey, this... do you know what it is?
I wonder what it is, it's a toy ring...
It's your present, ten years ago.
ten years ago?
It's too small to fit in, though.
…is a treasure.
oh yeah...
Do you remember what you said then?
eh? What did I do?
I wonder if I've already forgotten my feelings at that time...
e…?
No, nothing.
Thank you for today…. It was a wonderful birthday.
see you.
Yeah good night
Ah, it feels good on the roof.
yeah? Isn't that Gargantua over there?
Ha...
What's the matter, Gargantua? Sigh.
Ah, Pantagruelle, you've seen something bad about me.
really what happened? It's not like Gargantua.
It's not like I said it, so I'll say it... Actually, it's a slump.
What do you mean by slump?
just can't come up with a good idea.
If it's okay with me, I'll think about it with you, but...
Thank you. But now I want to think alone.
Yes, I will go. I hope you can come up with a good idea.
Yes. While cooling my head, I'll think about it.
GargantuaI wonder if it's okay... Over there, he's muttering something.
Ah, I can't think of an idea for the ultimate weapon of destruction.
‥‥‥‥. (What are you thinking about, this girl is...)
Coming to the zoo makes me want to do genetic manipulation experiments.
uh, right? (Nobody thinks that way...)
Wow.
What's wrong? Gargantua.
Koala: "Grin.
what? Koalas today.
A new bioweapon. I don't know whose money it is, but I'll take it.
Oh, um. Gargantua. What are you saying?
Only smash those who get in your way. Oh, I'm on fire
‥‥‥‥. (Don't listen to people's stories.)
Hi, Gargantua. what is this score
Fufun, how is it? A genius is a genius no matter what he does.
You know, Gargantua...
What.
This score won't come out unless all of them are strikes.
so what?
Gargantua doesn't really put out a strike.
But look. This score.
My machine is broken. I have to...
Excuse me. Absolutely no computer.
Ah, there's smoke.
yes? Come on, let's go home.
Gargantua, what have you done?
Look, I'm going home.
‥‥‥‥.
Gargantua. I'm going to the bathroom for a minute.
Please go ahead.
Ah, it's clean. what? That crowd.
Hi, Gargantua. what happened? This pile of coins...
It's decided. it's my strength
You know... Can I say something?
What. Say it.
A strange machine will connect you.
What that? I don't know.
Apart from that, it's fine... (I see a strange code.)
Ah, if bank machines were that easy to make, I wouldn't have any problems with research funds...
‥‥‥‥. (What is this girl thinking...)
It looks like they're having a special bargain today.
Bargain sale? Stock up. Here, help me.
Yes. (Even if you don't hurry, they won't sell out.)
This one, this one, they're all cheap. Buy them all.
Gargantua. I'm scared of what I'm buying...
I already bought a lot.
I agree. Shall we go home now? (Because I'm tired...)
not yet. It seems that other stores are also selling cheaply.
Huh. are you still going?
Come on, don't yell at me, just follow me.
yes yes (Ah, I want to go home already...)
That's Gargantua.
I looked for it. Pantagruelle, I'm going to investigate.
Where are you going?
There was a good research theme on the farm near the hotel.
Research again?
This is the crop circle. I will explain it scientifically.
The first time I saw.
Don't stand still, Investigate, Investigate. Start from the center.
Oh what Could it be UFO?
There is no such thing as an unidentified flying object in this world. I will expose myself.
Eh, huh?
What was it like now?
It was no big deal. You were 10,000 light years too early to challenge me.
A light year is a unit of distance, right?
Let's go.
Maybe we saved the earth from crisis...
We lost because of you.
I'm sorry.
Well, okay. Next time I'll definitely win.
I wonder if there's a next time...
I was waiting Pantagruelle.
Hi, Gargantua. what happened?
You are a hindrance to achieving my ambitions.
I have no recollection of disturbing Gargantua. And what about ambition?
Conquer the world.
Se, world domination? You must be joking.
I'm physically ready. But thanks to you, I'm not ready yet.
Why is it my fault?
If I can defeat you here, everything will be resolved. Come on, be prepared.
Wait a minute, Shiono-san. Let's go to the sandy beach because damage will occur in the park.
I lost. my failure.
All right? Did you get hurt?
I have decided which path I should take. Excuse me then.
Hi, Gargantua….
P.E. duty is troublesome. yeah? I feel for people...
Ah….
That's Gargantua. What are you doing here?
eh? Ah, ah, wait a minute.
Judging from the parenthesis, I'm in swimming class. You're slacking off.
No, no. That's not true. I was tired and just rested.
In that case, you don't have to rest behind the gym like this.
Whoa, here. Due to the depletion of the ozone layer, direct sunlight is harmful to the body.
Hoon. When did you become so sick?
Eh, Et... It's been a while.
Come to think of it, the teacher just called Gargantua.
Huh, lie. It's so dangerous
It's a joke to say that, and being in a hurry is, after all, slacking off.
Ah…. please. Keep quiet from your teacher.
Well, what should I do?
> Teacher Pantagruelle, what are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the ball.
Mezzanine earlseille. what are you doing Hurry up and bring me the ball.
Hey, hey, I'm calling you.
Cheek, I'll keep quiet from the teacher. don't thank me
thank you. Thank you.
Now it's Gargantua's turn.
I'm embarrassed.
what happened? It's not Gargantua-like to be shy.
Excuse me. I'm naive That's why I don't sing
yeah yeah But I want to hear Gargantua's beautiful voice...
Huh, right? What should I do….
I'm sure it's a singing voice like an angel...
I can't help but say that.
Hooray. They'll sing (But you have a smile on your face.)
‥‥‥‥. (Unreasonable, isn't it good...)
and an hour later
Here I come. Next is this.
‥‥‥‥. (I keep singing all the time, what's so naive...)
It's a little cooler today.
uh, right? I'm very hot.
Leary? That's not true.
Gargantua. Come on, let's go swimming.
I'm a little cold, so please refrain from doing so.
Even though you say it's cold, aren't you sweating? Come on, let's go.
No. It's not because it's hot.
Then what kind of sweat?
This is cold sweat.
eh? Why are you in a cold sweat...
I'm afraid of water So please.
Then I wish you would say yes.
Because it's not embarrassing to be afraid of water.
That's not true. There are things that everyone is not good at.
Thank you. But I also want to swim with you.
You don't have to be in a hurry, just take your time and get used to it.
Yes. I will.
wonderful. I'm a big fan of this guy's paintings.
Oh yeah. I'm glad you came.
Look how great this is. I'm numb.
agree.
Good... I wish I could draw like this...
・ ・ ・
I really like it... I've been watching for two hours.
ok i remember. Let's go home.
eh? Remember?
Before I forget, go home and draw a picture.
‥‥‥‥.
You can't see a starry sky like this in the city.
‥‥‥‥.
don't ignore it Gargantua.
‥‥‥‥.
Gargantua?
‥‥‥‥.
what are you sleeping Even so, it's a cute sleeping face...
Be kind and wake up. Leave Quincy to sleep.
Gargantua…. wake up….
Uh huh. Mumble...I love you.
What now... (Oops. I couldn't hear you very well.)
I fell asleep. Hey, didn't I say something weird?
Said, said
What did you say?
You like me
It's a lie, that kind of thing. It's the usual joke, right?
that's right. What are you panicking about?
No, I'm not in a hurry. Good
? ? Weird Gargantua.
Whoa, I fell asleep. I stayed up all night yesterday.
If that's the case, I should have slept more...
Since I was able to come with you, I can't help but sleep.
Oh yeah. I am glad.
By the way, wasn't my sleeping face weird?
It wasn't weird. It was cute
eh? Embarrassing…. But I'm happy.
I feel like the reaction is different from the usual Gargantua.
.......
What's wrong Pantagruelle?
I seem to have lost my way.
Don't Worry. There are people over there.
Oh, Gargantua, you're a foreigner. Oh, I'm talking to you
Excuse me. I want to ask you something.
What? What do you want?
Please, do you want to know the way to the inn?
don't know what you're talking about.
Go straight and there is an information desk on the right, so go there.
thank you. Turn right and go straight.
It's amazing that you can talk to foreigners.
Well, it seems that my feelings match.
Let's go home then.
Well, let's go home.
・ ・ ・
I was able to return to the hotel safely. As expected of Mr. Katagiri.
Huh, did you say that? Shall we ask others?
Don't worry, it's okay. Come on, let's go.
For some reason, I was able to return to the hotel safely.
that? What is that crowd...
Good morning. Pantagruelle.
Was it Gargantua?
Men gather where I am, and I'm in trouble.
On the contrary, it seems quite easy.
Ah, everyone said that they would bring this, so I had no choice...
yes. I thought you were holding it.
No, I didn't do that.
Gargantua, don't talk to this guy, let's go.
That's right. Gargantua.
Oh yeah. Last but not least, I didn't let you have it.
yes. Even if you don't push yourself to make sure...
Because if you get it wrong... Right on. alright, let's go.
But Gargantua is really good.
Oh, this outfit is pretty nice.
It's true, it's good
Which color would suit me?
Red suits you. Quincy brown looks good on you. Quincy blue suits you.
Well then, I'll try it on, so wait.
It's a great sense. Quite good.
After all, this is the color for Gargantua.
Do you really think this color suits you?
No, no? I think it's fine.
I have zero sense of beauty. Study fashion.
Yes...
Okay for now. What do you think when you actually see it?
That's right. Not good enough.
Yes. You should study a little more.
Yes...
Could you put some sunscreen on me?
yo welcome...
Please don't forget to apply it.
Oh, I'm furiously happy now...
Just don't touch anything strange.
Oh, I'm furiously happy now...
It's tickling, isn't it?
Oh, I'm furiously happy now...
Could you paint it more carefully?
Oh, I'm furiously happy now...
Ah, after all, this is what children see.
After all, it must be scary. Quincy, let's stop.
There's no way that's the case.
Then let's go in.
OK.
Gargantua. what happened?
No, it's nothing.
I'm afraid, really.
I can't be a child...
Wow.
I was surprised.
I don't want to get me out of here
Or Gargantua….
I was scared after all. Gargantua.
‥‥‥‥‥.
Don't be so depressed. I'm not good at anyone Because there is.
Well, that's true, but... At my age... I'm afraid of ghosts...
Ah, Gargantua from earlier was really cute.
Eh, cute? It's been years since you said that...
I guess so. You may call me beautiful, but...
Can I ask you one question?
what?
You're a pretty girl and you're beautiful... I'm going to stop.
Even though I don't have to stop...
Can you keep today's affairs a secret between just the two of us?
of course. OK.
Thank you. Thank you.
Anyway, Gargantua. I hated ghosts. Everyone has weaknesses.
Yes. let's stop.
Hey, Gargantua, where have you been?
Oh, it's dangerous. Move away.
eh?
It hurt... Gargantua Are you okay?
I'm fine You?
I'm fine too. Here, Gargantua I'll lend you a hand Get up.
Thank you.
Sorry. bump into each other.
OK. I had no other injuries.
Come to think of it, when we first met, I'm pretty sure we bumped into each other.
Oh yeah. I remember it well.
I can't forget. Because it's important...
what's important?
It doesn't suit me, so I'll stop saying it.
oh yeah...
Then let's slide.
I agree. (I wonder what Gargantua meant.)
Slow down, Gargantua.
sorry.
What happened? Suddenly...
My younger brother had a fever and collapsed, so I had to take care of him.
oh yeah... Then you should go home early.
Thank you. I am really sorry. Well then.
I lost my date, but it can't be helped.
Gargantua, I think I'm thinking of my brother...
It can not be helped. are you going home
Ah, Gargantua.
Mirror.
Something for you. Pantagruelle.
I'll send it Quincy, go ahead.
yes. Goodbye.
GargantuaIt looked cold.
Well, of course.
Gargantua, you look cold.
Kuh, Kushun.
If you don't mind, would you like to use my jacket?
I'm fine
That's not true. You'll catch a cold if you wear light clothes like that.
Well, if you say so much, you can use it.
Shall we go home?
wait.
Gargantua, what are you doing?
That way, you should be a little warmer, too.
I'm so happy to be able to join arms with Gargantua.
It helped me during this time. Yes, this jacket.
For Gargantua, it doesn't matter.
Of course. Then excuse me.
The tear has been mended. Unexpectedly, it's homely
Ah, that's Mr. Kisaragi. It must be hard to hold a heavy book.
Sounds tough, Gargantua.
Pantagruelle, no, no.
I'll take it for you, can you lend it to me?
No, it's okay. And it will cause trouble...
You should leave this sort of thing to a man.
Eh... but...
It's okay, it's okay Good shot.
Oh, thank you. I am very happy.
So how far should I carry this?
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you please go to the library...
It's cheap.
You are really kind...
If you're a pretty girl like Gargantua, I'll always help you out.
Or, it's cute..., that's what it is... happy….
Look, if we don't go to the library soon, class will start.
That's right. Let's go early.
Is it useless if I don't get on?
I will definitely ride. Quincy Let's stop.
Is that so. Well then, I will prepare myself. Quincy was great... Let's go back. Quincy Dami
It was a thrill. Gargantua.
‥‥‥‥.
Gargantua. what happened?
Gargantua, are you okay? (This is bad. I'm completely unconscious.)
Uh huh.
Oh, did you notice? Was good.
I... After all, I fainted.
For now, let's get off.
So I was reluctant...
Sorry. I never thought it would turn out like this.
No, I should have refused too...
I won't force you anymore, so I'm sorry.
Um, I'm resting in the shade because direct sunlight isn't good for my body.
Oh yeah. Then I'll go out with you too.
Um... if it's about me, you can leave it alone.
I can't go that route.
Since you've come all the way to the beach, you don't have to match me...
I didn't just want to come to the sea.
Really? If so...
I wanted to come to the sea with Gargantua. So if Gargantua is in the shade, I'm happy to do so too.
Eh, I'm happy... I'm sorry though. If you are in good health...
It's okay, it's okay We even got to see Gargantua in a swimsuit.
Eh, please don't look at me too much. It's embarassing….
Gargantua is so cute...
Gargantua…. Gargantua….
‥‥‥‥.
No reply...
It is useless. He seems to be absorbed in a book and can't hear his voice.
‥‥‥‥.
Let's just leave it alone.
Shall we go home soon?
Are you ready for the book?
yes. Um... did you talk to me when you were reading a book?
Well, well. But it wasn't a big deal.
sorry. When I fall in love with a book...
You don't have to worry about that. Come on, let's go home.
Yes, thank you.
Dull….
yeah? Gargantua Are you crying?
Dull…. poor….
Gargantua, it's easy to be impressed...
"With today's screening, we will conclude today's screening.
Today's movie was very good.
Speaking of which, Gargantua. I would have cried on the way.
eh…. were you watching? Embarrassing….
The face without the glasses was cute.
It's so cute...
I... should I not wear glasses?
I agree. I'm in good shape. That's not true.
Is that so…?
Why don't you take the plunge and make contact? Everyone will be amazed.
Contacts are a little scary...
But even now, she's still cute enough...
Even if it's flattering, I'm happy...
Is that so? Even if it's flattering, I'm happy...
It's a little hot... Do you want to go to the infirmary?
that? Gargantua. what happened?
Pantagruelle I got a little injured in P.E.
All right? Were you dazed again?
yes. while playing volleyball.
It's dangerous if you do that while playing. Be careful.
I agree. Thank you for your advice.
you're welcome. I don't think you should be thanked.
By the way, what are you here for?
Ah, yes. It was a little hot, wasn't it?
You can't do that. Keep calm.
When I saw Gargantua's face, I was healed.
Really? If you can heal with something like this, Please take a look at it.
Oh yeah. Thank you. (It's not like that...)
Well then, I'll be back in the classroom soon.
Gargantua. Don't be too dazed.
Yes, please take care of your body. excuse me.
It's Gargantua-like to get hurt in a daze.
Pantagruelle Hello.
Ah, Gargantua. what happened?
This is the sweater I was knitting in the park the other day.
Eh, to me? Thank you.
I'm glad that you liked the color. What about size?
let's see? All right. It's perfect.
Sounds like you did well. how is it? Are you happy?
No. Of course I am extremely happy.
Is that so. It was worth the effort.
Gargantua. Do you really want me to take this?
of course. Excuse me then.
Oh, happy Warm like the heart of Gargantua.
There is something I would like to see, so please come back later.
is fast. (Gargantua could run so fast...)
・ ・ ・
Where did Gargantua go...? Oh, I was there.
Gargantua, I searched. It's in the carnivorous plant corner.
Look. Don't you think it has an interesting shape?
It's called Nepenthes, and it eats insects.
Your father said that gentlemen are carnivorous plants, but I'm not sure.
That's right... No, let's stop.
Why? It's so cute and it even comes with a lid.
‥‥‥‥. (It does have a lid, but is it cute?)
Just looking at it is fun.
Hey, Gargantua. Why don't you go ahead soon?
indeed. Shall we go?
There seems to be a special event for the dolphin show today.
Really? I would definitely like to see it.
Well then, let's go.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, but can you go ahead for a moment?
understood. Well then, I'll be waiting.
I've been wanting to go to the bathroom since a while ago.
・ ・ ・
Well, I'm keeping Gargantua waiting. I need to go early.
Zappan
Wow.
Hey, Gargantua. All right?
Water was poured on me. I'm soaking wet.
Everyone is running away, why is only Gargantua covered in water?
Why?
Oh, the person in charge brought me a towel. (I guess I was staring blankly again anyway...)
Anyway, I'm glad it's summer.
I agree. My clothes are already dry.
That's right. (It's a pity, I was able to see through your underwear just now...)
Let's go.
That's Gargantua. What about that luggage?
I'm knitting right now, so I bring it with me so I can knit anywhere.
Well then, you can sit on a bench and knit.
No. It's rude to do that.
I've always wanted to try talking to a knitting girl.
Is that so? Excuse me then.
Heh, you're skillful.
I like it, so I often knit it at home.
I see. A present for someone?
indeed. I'll keep it a secret.
Oh yeah. But it's a nice color.
Is that so? I'm glad you like it.
happy…? (Why?)
Knitting here is difficult.
Happy is the person who receives something knitted by Gargantua.
Is that so? Well, I have to do my best I can't.
Really handy... (It would be nice if someone could get it...)
It's my first time to come ski.
Oh, is that so? Well then, ski wear and other set...?
For today, my father bought it for me.
oh yeah... (He's rich.)
oh yeah... (As expected, rich people are different...)
You ride on something called a lift, like this swing.
Hey, Gargantua. If it's your first time, you should practice below.
I'm looking forward to it. Let's ride.
‥‥‥‥. oh ok
Come on, let's ride.
Wow.
Are you okay? Gargantua. Here, hold it in your hand.
I was surprised. It's difficult to get on the lift.
That's right. (Just Gargantua.)
Even so, I've come to a high place.
copper? Gargantua. Are you ready to get off?
Wait a minute, that's impossible. Let's get you on the lift down.
You can't take the lift down.
Really? I was troubled. What to do now?
have no choice but to go down slowly while falling.
Is that so... So let's do that.
Is it alright? Gargantua.
Don
Ah, good evening.
yeah? who might that be. But this voice...?
very sorry. I'm a little overwhelmed...
Are you Koshiki-san? It's like a completely different person.
What so?
I'm here to take a bath. How was the water temperature?
Thank you very much for the water temperature. but….
but?
Sorry for the small bath.
that? Was there a bath other than the large public bath?
From what I've seen, it's a space where only about 50 people can be together, but...
! ?
It's time to call your father, so excuse me.
Maybe the bath at home is super huge?
Ah, that's Gargantua. I'm holding a heavy book, but I'm carrying it lightly.
Sounds tough, Gargantua.
Pantagruelle No problem at all.
I'll take it for you, can you lend it to me?
It's okay. I'm not that soft.
You should leave this sort of thing to a man.
It's the first time I've been told that. Thank you. I'm so happy...
It's okay, it's okay ok... Ohhhh.
Oooh, heavy... I used to have something like this...
Well then, can you carry me to the staff room?
Oh, it's cheap... I need you.
Hey, it might not be cheap.
But it's the first time I've had a boy carry my luggage, so I'm kind of embarrassed.
What are you talking about? I can't let a girl carry such a heavy thing.
You're so kind... Happiness, I wonder if I feel it at times like this...
Come on, Gargantua. I'm sorry, but let's go to the staff room quickly.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so happy... Would you like half?
No, no. Here we go.
Well done. I feel like I'm really alive
For real. Well done, isn't it?
What is it, I wonder if it's done?
Ah, Gargantua. Don't touch it.
uh, right? Ah!
I got it.
eh? (Oh, that's bad.)
What should I do...
What are you doing? I'll run away
eh?
As it is, I wonder if it's okay...
All right. because no one can see I'm fine.
But my conscience doesn't hurt...
When you find out, that time is that time. I'll do something
What are you going to do?
I think about it then...
As expected, I'm going to apologize.
Ah, Gargantua. It can't be helped. Shall I go too?
Thank you. thank you together
I don't mind doing that. But it was good. Forgive me easily.
For real. Was good.
Why did you destroy something so precious? Oh, okay...
well done I feel like I'm really alive.
For real. Well done, isn't it?
What is it made of?
Ah, Gargantua. Don't touch it.
It's okay. I'm in a bad mood.
i don't know Even if you get angry...
Ah.
I got it.
eh? (Oh, that's bad.)
What should I do...
What are you doing? I'll run away
eh?
I left it as it was.
All right. because no one can see I'm fine.
Something hurts my conscience.
When you find out, that time is that time. I'll do something
What do you mean?
I think about it then...
I'm worried. As expected, I'm going to apologize.
Ah, Gargantua. It can't be helped. Shall I go too?
Thank you. thank you together
I don't mind doing that. But it was good. Forgive me easily.
it's true is not it. Was good.
Why did you destroy something so precious? Oh, okay...
amazing. There are not many people who can come this far.
Thank you. Oh, the clouds are getting suspicious.
Is true. The weather suddenly turned bad.
It's going to rain.
Shhh.
What's wrong?
Ah, me, thunder... No, you can't.
Shhh.
All right. Because I'm with you Rest assured.
No.
No matter what, it's dangerous here, so let's go to the shadows of the rocks.
It looks like it's raining. All right? not cold?
It's okay. Don't worry. But that...
what?
sorry. Hugging. Was it annoying?
No, it's not annoying. To say the least, I was happy.
Oh, were you really happy?
sure.
Was good…. I was happy when you cheered me up...
uh, right? Was good….
Let's swim back again.
Ah. The cyclamen are already blooming.

It's up to me Those words hurt.
Sorry Sorry. But a shy heart... Kukuku.
It doesn't matter if you don't think so.
Oh, I believe Yes, Gargantua, how shy.
That way of saying something.
I kind of laughed that Gargantua was shy. But I know a lot about flowers.
Even so, Gargantua is throwing with brute force.
Ah. Avoid!
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, I hit it.
Say it.
I'm sorry. All right?
It's okay.
It doesn't look like he's bleeding either, so that's good...
Don't worry about it. See, let's continue.
No. I am really sorry.
You've become more girly lately...
Even so, Gargantua is throwing with brute force.
Ah. Avoid!
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, I hit it.
Say it.
Oh, I'm alive again. Bad bad My hand slipped a little.
It's not bad Your face is fragile.
If you put a brim on it, it will heal. If anything, can I put it on?
eh? ok...
Ahahahaha. It turned bright red... You must be joking.
‥‥‥‥. Absolutely forgive me.
I'm sorry. don't be so angry I apologize properly.
Dumped.
sorry. It was really bad. I'm reflecting.
If you go that far, you can forgive me.
For real? Let's continue.
Are you really reflecting?
It's suddenly raining. I'm glad I brought an umbrella. Ah, Gargantua.
Gargantua. what happened?
Ah, um... It suddenly rained...
Didn't you bring an umbrella?
Yes...
If you don't mind, would you like to come in with me?
eh. What should I do...
Not good. Or do you hate me?
No, that's not true. Because...
Let's go home together. It doesn't look like it will ever stop.
Yes... Then together...
All right, let's go.
‥‥‥‥.
Gargantua is really quiet...
‥‥‥‥.
Gargantua. Are you bored with me?
Well, that's not the case...
Then why don't you say anything?
That's... that…. I'm nervous...
Oh yeah. (Are you nervous... you're so cute...)
No, that's not true. Because...
Let's go home together. It doesn't look like it will ever stop.
So, but... It's embarrassing because...
Well then, I'll lend you this umbrella.

Gargantua.
Ah, um...
Kuu…. I'm cool

Ah, Gargantua.
Hi, yesterday... Thank you very much. And very, I was happy...
no problem. It's no big deal.
Or the body, Are you okay?

Was good…. What should I do if I catch a cold?
It's just a quick bite to catch a cold for cute Gargantua.
Oh, that kind of thing... Well then, I'll return this to you...
Thank you for taking the trouble to bring this to me.
I'm really thankful to you.
Gargantua is really cute.

-Fuck fighters, remember that.

House. fine.
Was good.
but….
but?
Wow, do I look so... childish?
No, not at all. Probably because Gargantua is cute.
Or cute... is embarrassing...
If I were a combatant, I might target Gargantua.
Is that so...
Your face is red now.
that? It looks like Gargantua hasn't come yet.
+ dog doggie.
that? it's a dog
Excuse me. Sorry I made you wait.
Ah, Gargantua. I just got here too.
Was good. Look, Muk. come over here

Gargantua. Cute dog. May I touch you?
Yes... Please.

It's okay. It looks like he wasn't really chewing.
I'm usually quiet, but... Muk, what's wrong?

I wonder if that's true... Right, Muk?

That's right... Was good….
did you say something?
No…. No, nothing...
Gargantua. There's a strange animal over there.
‥‥‥‥.
Mi, Gargantua?
It is useless. He's obsessed with monkeys and can't hear their voices.
‥‥‥‥.
It can't be helped, I wonder if I'll see monkeys too.
Excuse me... I like animals... I've been staring at them...
Besides, I don't care. More than that, there's a strange animal over there.
Heh, is that a strange animal...?
yes. Let's go see it soon.
Yes...
Let's move away from the railing for a while.
that…. I'm scared, so... hand….

Mi, Gargantua? what happened?
Eh... it's okay...

Ah, um...
Ah, Gargantua.
Um... well, if you don't mind... would you like to go home with me?
yep, OK. It's late now.
Oh, thank you.
Shall we go then?
Yes.
! ?
What's the matter, Gargantua? (I'm running fast.)
This child seems to have been abandoned...
Did you hear this kitten meow?
Poor... I'm so trembling...
Gargantua, you really like animals.
It was cold, wasn't it? I'll take you home right away.
You're hungry too. Don't worry, I'll warm the milk for you.
Gargantua, let me get you there quickly.
Yes. I agree.
I drove Gargantua home.
Well, it's time for lunch. I have to go to school cafeteria soon...
Pantagruelle.
Ah, Gargantua.
Are we going to have lunch now? Did you bring your lunch?
No, no. From now on, I'm going to go to the school cafeteria.
Good then.
What?

This is a delicious situation.
I don't know if it will suit my taste, but... If you don't mind, will you eat me?

I'm going to swim after a little rest.
I have no guts. Well then, let's go for a swim.
Oh, the pool is noisier.
Ah. Gargantua is drowning. I have to help you.
Gargantua, Gargantua. It is useless. Consciousness does not return.
It can not be helped. Mouth-to-mouth only artificial respiration.
All right, let's go.
Uh huh.
Unfortunately, no, it was good. He seems to have regained consciousness.
that? Why am I here...
Gargantua. All right? can you get up
yes. Don't worry.
I've drowned Could it be that you helped me?
No. Just in case….
Thank you. Thanks for helping me...
No, of course. But I was worried. I couldn't regain consciousness, so I started artificial respiration.
eh? artificial respiration? Did you do it?
No, just when I thought about it, I just regained consciousness.
oh yeah... I wish I had fainted a little more...
eh? What now...
No, nothing... Well, rather than that kind of thing, I want to rest a little.
Well then, take a good rest here.
yes. do so.
wow i'm doing it i'm doing it
Gargantua likes baseball, doesn't he?
i love to see I really wanted to see this match.
Oh yeah. Good for you.
Oh, I'm out. It's a hit.
Gargantua.
Good luck. It's a home run.
Um, Gargantua...?
Ah, don't give up halfway through.
It is useless. I am totally into baseball.
yeah? Did you notice this?
Come on, let's support each other together.
That's right. (This is no good.)
that?
what happened?
Isn't that kid lost?
Well, maybe.
I'll be there for a while
Gargantua is good at taking care of people.
After all, this child seems to be a lost child.
What should I do? Shall I take you to the Lost Child Guidance Center?
Yeah let's do that
> lost child aen. No, I don't want to move from here.
What is it, you motherfucker.
I'm in trouble.
For real. What should I do?
Well then, I'm here to comfort this child, sorry, but can you go to the Lost Child Center?
It can not be helped. are you coming
I would like to guide you to a lost child.
Phew…. Anyway, it was broadcast. Return to Gargantua.
that? That shit, no, that kid?
As soon as it aired, my mother came to pick me up.
Oh yeah. Good for you.
yes. It was really good. Thanks dear.
No. It's nothing. (At Gargantua's request.)
Yo. are you listening?
what. Yoshio?
Mr. Nijino seems to have gone down with a cold.
Eh, Mr. Nijino?
Didn't you force me to do it yesterday?
I'm not doing anything
Hmm, is that so? But just in case, show up at Nijino-san's place.
understood. See you.
It's time to turn off the lights.
I guess we have no choice. I'm curious about how Nijino-san is doing, but should I sleep?
Today is free action day. I promised to go with Gargantua, but...
Yesterday, I heard that Yoshio was down with a cold, but it was that bad.
Let's go to Gargantua's room. Quincy wait a little longer
Gargantua. Pantagruelle though. All right?
No reply. Oh no.
To, Gargantua okay?
Ah, Pantagruelle.
why are you here
Gargantua is sick, but I can't go alone.
eh….
That's it. Would you like me to wet your towel?
No. I'm fine. I'll do it myself, so that's good.
That's not true. All right, Gargantua, lie down.
Shall I ask you then?
yes.
It's cold.
How are you feeling?
yes. Thank you.
I'll be by your side forever today, so sleep in peace.
I don't want to catch a cold all the time...
eh? What now...
No, nothing...
Today is a beautiful day. (I've never seen Ijuin's face...)
Hey, it's hard!
What's the matter, are you in such a hurry...
According to the information I just received, Ijuin has been kidnapped.
What, Ijuin kidnapped? (For some reason, I thought he wasn't here from the morning...)
Right now, he's being confined in an abandoned factory on the riverbed.
OK, so what should I do?
Alright, let's go too! Quincy Hmmm, yeah.
Oh, would you lay down your life for your friend? Well then, I'm here to answer the phone...
What are you saying. You're going too!
Open…. I have a sudden stomach ache... I have to hurry to the infirmary...
My belly is in good shape... Then do you want to go alone?
What are these guys... Damn, you naughty guys.
Now, where is Ijuin?
Hi.
Hey, Ijuin! You were kidnapped...
Hmm…. What are you doing here?
I had some free time, so...
I see, did you worry about me?
W-Who cares...
But it was in vain. The case has just been settled by our private army.
Are these nasty guys part of your family's army?!
About five minutes after the incident, I think.
What happened to the culprit?
I made my body remember what would happen if I stood against the Ijuin family.
What the hell did you do?
Well then, I'll let you go back to school as soon as possible. You should go back to school soon.
What are you doing back? Who do you think you came all this way for? Ahh, it's so stupid... Let's go home...
Hmm, cold guy. Don't you have the warm heart of a human being?
human mind? I mean, he's got a house, a private army, and stuff like that.
It's like a private army...
It's okay! They seem to have better equipment than the police.
But...
Besides, even if we were worried, the case won't be solved quickly.
Yes, that's right. Am I worrying too much...
yeah, worrying too much. Since it's about Ijuin, he said he'd be right back.
that's true. Then I'll go back to class.
What's wrong? It seems you were talking about me just now.
Hey, Ijuin! You were kidnapped...
kidnapping? What the hell is this?
Now that you've been kidnapped...
Phew. Such a groundless rumor... Because this is all common people...
So, is the kidnapping story a lie?
Even if that story is true, I just realize how foolish it is to confront the Ijuin family.
‥‥‥‥.
Then I'll excuse myself.
The Ijuin family... I don't want to turn to the enemy too much.
Hurry up and get back to the classroom.
Don
Kya.
I'm sorry... What is Gargantua? You're talking like a woman...
What are you? Take care.
What are you in a hurry?
Oh, I'm not in a hurry. Well then, I'll excuse myself.
What is he... I ran away. Weird guy...
Hey. It's big news.
What's the matter, Yoshio? in such a hurry.
I just heard something amazing.
what is it. What an amazing thing...
Listen and be amazed. Actually….
actually….
That Ijuin...
Ijuin is...
Actually, oh...
Gagaan.
What's the matter, Yoshio? come on.
Noisy. What the hell happened?
Ah, Ijuin. Yoshio suddenly...
yeah? I don't like this. Call the private doctors of the Ijuin family immediately.
I wonder if it's okay Yoshio guy.
Oh well, he'll be back in good health soon. Excuse me then.
after school that day
Yo.
Was Yoshio safe?
What are you talking about?
You were taken to the hospital in Ijuin in the morning, weren't you?
I don't know that.
eh? So what's the news about Ijuin?
What's that? Weird guy. Let's go now.
‥‥‥‥. What's going on?
I was there.
I'm sorry.
No. no problem.
really sorry. Well then….
Weird hairstyle.
I'm sorry.
Huh, we bumped into each other before, didn't we?
Huh, is that so? But I forgot. Well then….
After all, it's that girl.
I'm sorry. I bumped into you again.
little by little. It's my third time.
really sorry. Well then….
Please take it easy.
Ah. I bumped into you again.
that's enough. No matter how many times you hit me.
Don't give up like that. sorry. Well then….
It would be nice if you could tell me your name.
I'm sorry every time.
Also, is it a hit shop? OK. I'm giving up already.
Well then, from now on, I'll bump into you without hesitation.
Don't bump into me.
Next, it's time for physical education. I have to hurry to the gym.
Ah, I forgot something in the classroom. Can't you go back?
Garat
- Female student ‥‥‥‥‥‥‥.
Oh, it's dangerous...
-Schoolgirl. Take a peek.
Run away!
-Schoolgirl. someone is looking
Run away!

That girl will bump into you at school too...

You said Tatebayashi... who might that be?
Don

-Mysterious woman... I bumped into him again.
Ah, you...
-Mysterious woman... Oh my God. Actually, It's not a coincidence.
I guess that's right.
Did you get it? My name is Miharu Tatebayashi. I'm sorry for bumping into you so many times.
No, I don't mind.
‥‥‥‥.
what happened.
Hmm, nothing. Instead, let's go for a walk.
Then let's go to the tree-lined street.
I dreamed of walking this road with you...
Oh yeah.
‥‥‥‥.
tons
eh?
Just a little... stay like this...
Thank you very much for coming today.
No, it was fun.
You're kind.
uh, right?
I wish I had gathered my courage sooner. Then maybe...
‥‥‥‥.
Thank you for the wonderful memories. I, you..., you...
eh?
Goodbye!
‥‥‥‥. Gargantua, huh?
‥‥‥‥. go home.
Yo. Hey, I have something to tell you.

Oh, it's delicious. Gargantua. (This is the kindness of a man.)
is that true? Yay! There are a lot of them, so please eat more and more.
Thank you. But the beautifully made lunch box is a waste.
Can you eat another woman's lunch box but not the graceful one?
That's not true. It's just that...
can't you eat?
 Oh, I'm so happy I can't believe I can eat such a delicious lunch box.
Feeling dead, I have to eat.

Gargantua. Are you satisfied with this?
yes. I'm so happy.
That's good.
Ah, look. A lot of couples are riding.
That's right.
I wonder if Yumi and the others look like that too...
Gargantua is cute, so it might look like siblings.
Is grace childish? I don't want that.
Hey, hey, Gargantua. Because she's Yoshio's little sister.
Then do you hate childish girls?
No, not at all.
Is that so? Then good.
Gargantua says something that makes me nervous...
wow, i'm doing it
Gargantua likes wrestling.
Yeah, I love it. I often watch it with my brother.
Yoshio and... I wonder if he always likes me...
Ah, today's main event. I wanted to see this match.
Oh yeah. Good for you.
There it is. let's go
Ah, um...
It was. DDT.
Um, Gargantua? The person in the front seat will see your pants.
Then there's the fall. Ah, it was returned.
It is useless. I can't hear you at all. I can't help but leave it alone...
Did you finally notice?
Hey, did you see the technique just now?
Huh? I was watching.
Well, when I called my brother the other day, he couldn't move for a while.
Oh yeah. (Yoshio, you grew up in a pretty strict household.)
later, OK. Recently, my brother is developing a new technique. I'll show you when I can.
Thank you. (Yoshio's guy is starting to feel like Fubin.)
Oh, that's amazing. Powerbomb decided.
It is useless. I got into it again.
It's a little windy today. Is it alright?
That's fine. Hurry up and let's go.
No. (I hope the lift doesn't stop...)
See, we have to hurry. I'll leave it there.
Wait a moment. Gargantua.
Oh, the lift has stopped.
The lift has stopped.
Yu, Gargantua. It's okay. So don't cry.
Fehn. Graces, are you going to die?
Such an exaggeration. It's okay. do not Cry.
it's over now. I'm sure you'll die. Ahn, Ahn.
‥‥‥‥. (Until it starts to move, I have no choice but to leave it alone...)
Before I die, I have one request...
what? Say it. (That's why I won't die...)
I love beautiful things...
Ah, it moved. It seems that I was saved.
See, that's why I said it's okay. This kind of thing happens often.
yes. sorry. I caused trouble.
no problem. By the way, what was your request?
Today is enough. I will give it another chance.
yes. Then it's fine. Let's slide.
yes.
It's cold today. Oh, it's snowing
ding dong
What is that?
Hello Pantagruelle.
That's right, Yumi-chan. what happened.
It's snowing a lot outside. Let's have a snowball fight.
snowball fight?
hurry, hurry.
Ah, Yumi-chan, don't pull me.
Ugh, it's so cold.
Pokka
Wow! ?
Hahahaha, I did it, I did it!
Oh, you did it!
Yumi, I've always been good at snowball fights.
I'm confident too. I will not lose.
Yumi doesn't take it easy either.
Alright, let's go!
I had a fun snowball fight with Yumi.
It was a lot of fun. Let's do it again when it snows.
agree.
Goodbye.

It was a great number of customers.
You really were a great guest. I'm tired and exhausted...
But it was good. Many people read our poems.
Next year, too, let's do interesting research that will attract many visitors.
There weren't many customers.
It's sober... I don't think people are interested in this sort of thing.

I'm really tired.
‥‥‥‥.
If it weren't for someone, there would have been a few more customers...
Who are you talking about?
There's no way something written by such an insensitive person would be interesting.
‥‥‥‥. (Is that about me?)
What should I do. Next, it's my turn...
It's okay, Gargantua can handle it.
Is that so? Ah, the person in front has finished.
It's okay. Do it with confidence and you'll be fine.
Yeah, I'll try. Well then, I'll come.
Phew, it looks like it went well.
That's why I said okay.
Yes, thank you. Your encouragement seems to have worked.
Oh yeah. Somehow, I can shine.
Believe in yourself and do your best when it's your turn.
Thank you.
What should I do. Next, it's my turn...

Phew, it looks like it went well.
That's why I said okay.
Yes, thank you. but it's okay? Now it's your turn.
That's right! It's okay. Leave it to me.

Thank you for returning my lines exactly as they were.

If you believe in yourself, you will do well.
Thank you.
What should I do. Next, it's my turn...
It's okay, Gargantua can handle it.
Alone I have to concentrate.
are you OK….
Just keep quiet and you won't be able to concentrate.
Because...
oh it's my turn... If you fail, it's your fault.
Phew, it looks like it went well without fail.
‥‥‥.
I was so nervous because I couldn't concentrate before going up on stage.
‥‥‥‥‥. Ah, next, it's my turn.
It would be nice if I failed...
It's your first time on stage, so you're really nervous, aren't you?
Can I say my lines properly? I got worried
Me too. What should I do.
Anyway, I can't help but think about it. I'm sure it will work out.
I guess so.
Remember to practice and believe in yourself.
That's right, I practiced that much.

It's your first time on stage, so you're really nervous, aren't you?
Can I say my lines properly? I got worried
Me too. What should I do.
Anyway, I can't help but think about it. I'm sure it will work out.
I wonder.
It's my first time on stage, so I have to do well...
Can I say my lines properly?
Well, the first line is...
that…. Do not ignore….
Ah, it's time to go.
think I've gotten used to it, but I still get nervous before the actual performance.
It's okay, just leave it to me.
Yeah I believe
By the way, what was my first line?
What are you talking about these days? I have to read the script again soon.
I think I've gotten used to it, but I still get nervous before the actual performance.
It's okay, just leave it to me.
Are you sure you're okay? My voice is hoarse.
I've practiced so much, I can't fail.
That's right. I practiced like that.
By the way, what was my first line?
What are you talking about these days? The curtain has already opened. Read the script quickly.
After all, I get nervous before a performance...
It's okay, just leave it to me.
I have to go now.
This year, I'm glad it's finally like a normal theater.
Up until now, all I've been announcing is weird stuff.
yes. That's why I was so excited to practice.
It's a pity that there is no kiss scene.
Yeah, sorry...
e?
No, nothing. Oh, I have to prepare.
This year, I'm glad it's finally like a normal theater.
Up until now, all I've been announcing is weird stuff.
yes. That's why I got into practice.
It's a pity that there is no kiss scene.
What are you thinking now? Oh, I have to prepare.
I can finally play normally.
Up until now, all I've been announcing is weird stuff.
Dissatisfaction remains with the performers, but... I have to prepare.
Phew, I managed to finish it.
It was well received by the audience, and I have nothing to say.
I'm glad the practice was worth it.
Phew, I managed to finish it.
I wonder if the reaction of the audience was not so good...
Well…. It was a little disappointing, but...
Next year, I have to practice more and do well.
Phew, it's finally over...
It was well received by the audience, and I have nothing to say.
‥‥‥. I was dissatisfied with the performers, but...
is that about me?
Phew, it's finally over...
I wonder if the reaction of the audience was not so good...
If someone doesn't stop there...
‥‥‥‥.
Phew, I managed to finish it.
It was well received by the audience, and I have nothing to say.
I'm glad the last piece went well.
Phew, I managed to finish it.
I wonder if the reaction of the audience was not so good...
Well…. This year was the last time...
Phew, it's finally over...
It was well received by the audience, and I have nothing to say.
In the last work, I'm glad someone didn't stop.
is that about me?
Phew, it's finally over...
I wonder if the reaction of the audience was not so good...
Even though it was the last time this year, Whose fault is it already?
‥‥‥‥.
From now on, it's a demonstration of chemical experiments. I wonder if I can do it well.
It's okay. All you have to do is experiment as usual.
That's right, it's okay. I believe
From now on, it's time for a demonstration of the drug experiment. I wonder if I can do it well.
If you fail, I'll laugh out loud.
Don't put that kind of pressure on me.
Hahahahaha…. Sorry Sorry. It's okay, you'll succeed.
I believe in those words.
I'm about to demonstrate the drug experiment. I wonder if I can do it well.
As long as you do your usual experiments, you should be fine.
But I'm really nervous.
Gargantua, we're about to demonstrate a drug experiment, right?
‥‥‥. What's wrong with that?
No, I wouldn't do anything about it, but...
yes. Don't talk to me about it. Because it's distracting.
‥‥‥‥.
looks like it worked Was good.
That's why I said it would work.
Yes, thank you.
Wait a minute, I failed.
Gargantua, are you okay? It looks like something exploded.
yeah, okay. Sorry for worrying you.
looks like it worked Was good.
That's why I said it would work.
Yes, thank you.
Wait a minute, I failed.
were you okay? It looks like something exploded.
yeah, okay. It was a little hot, but...
looks like it worked Was good.
That's why I said it would work.
Yes, thank you.
I kind of failed.
were you okay? It looks like something exploded.
yeah, okay.
Phew, it worked.
Thank you for your good work.
‥‥‥‥.
Oh, I was distracted and it didn't work.
‥‥‥‥.
From now on, it will be a demonstration of laser art. I get a little nervous.
I think you'll be fine. Just press the switch.
That's right, but... After all, I get nervous when I'm in front of people.
It will get dark soon, so be patient.
Yeah, I have to be patient for a while.
From now on, it will be a demonstration of laser art. I get a little nervous.
It's okay. Just press the switch.

That's right, but... After all, if it's in front of people, I'll get upset...
It will get dark soon, so be patient.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a demonstration of laser art. I have to do my best...
I think you'll be fine. Just press the switch.
Then you should do it...
No matter how many times you look at it, it's beautiful. I wanted to see the two of us alone...
e? What did you just say?
No, nothing.
No matter how many times you look at it, it's beautiful. I was fascinated by the operation.
That's right, the magic of light.
Yeah, if it's like this, you can do it every year.
No matter how many times you look at it, it's beautiful. I was fascinated by the operation.
That's right, the magic of light.
If it's like this, I want to see it every year.
No matter how many times I look at it, it's beautiful. It would have been nice to be with a nice person...
You mean you can't go with me?
Oh, it's boring.
I wonder if it's okay to do such a dangerous experiment.
I haven't moved it yet, though. seems to be fine
Even so, I wonder who made such an amazing machine.
It seems that someone in the Cyber Club designed it and made it in the Science Club.
Was it designed by someone from the Cyber Department?
I don't know what the theory is.
Are you really okay...?
It was working fine when I saw it, so don't trust me.
yes…. Trust….
Hey, I wonder if it's okay to do such a dangerous experiment.
It's not okay I haven't moved it yet, though.
Even so, I wonder who made such an amazing machine.

I wonder if it's okay to do something like this...
here we go….
‥‥‥‥.
Pantagruelle. Did you make a fortune-telling program?
Of course. Isn't that obvious?
What kind of divination?
 Blood type predicts compatibility between two people.
Huh, that's amazing. Hey, why don't you try fortune-telling with me...?
OK. Then enter the data...
Ah, looks like you got the results.
How did you come out?
Was good…. They go well together.
You look happy.
I wonder if it's something like this.
The result is neither poison nor medicine.
I wonder if we are incompatible.
Fortune-telling is a game.
That's right.
Yes Yes.
Pantagruelle. Fortune-telling program Did you make it properly?
Of course. Isn't that obvious?
what kind of fortune telling?
Blood type predicts compatibility between two people.
Hmm. I wonder if it hits?
Shall we test your compatibility with Gargantua?
Yeah, let's do it
Then enter the required data...
Ah, looks like you got the results.
How did you come out?
Heh, we're a good match.
happy?
Well, it's not like that, but...

Heh, we're a good match.
Sounds like it.
Well, it's something like this.
The result is neither poison nor medicine.
We are really incompatible.
Fortune-telling is a game.
Gargantua. I made a fortune-telling program, but...
So...?
It's a fortune-telling, but... If you don't mind, why don't you try it?
I'm fine refrain from it.
Oh yeah.
That's why I have work to do.
can't help it.
What's the best match? Not bad at all.
What, it's not that bad, is it?
As expected, I wonder if it is.
Pantagruelle. Did you make a game to exhibit?
Of course. I've made a masterpiece. Look.
Huh. It looks very difficult. Hey, can you show me how?
OK, let's see. You should stop Quincy.
No, let's stop.
No way?
OK, let's see. You should stop Quincy.
After all, I will stop.
do you hate it that much? I'm sorry, I can't say that...
Great, good.
copper? Gargantua will also try.
It seems a little impossible to me.
I'm like this too. It seems very difficult.
Just a shock.
Pantagruelle. Did you make a game to exhibit?
Of course. I've made a masterpiece. Look.
Huh. It looks very difficult. Hey, can you show me how to do it?
OK, let's see. You should stop Quincy.

Have you made a game to exhibit?
Of course. I've made a masterpiece. Look.
That's fine.
Hey Gargantua. can't you watch the game?
separately. something you don't want to see.
oh yeah...
Do you want to play alone and lonely?
Hey, isn't this dangerous?
here we go? I'm not sure, but it's okay, isn't it?
It's okay... I think it's dangerous after all...
There's no way you can hijack a certain A country's military satellites that easily.
Yeah, that's right. I look like an idiot I'm worried...
Hey, isn't this dangerous?
here we go? I'm not sure, but it's okay, isn't it?
It's okay... Such a sloppy…. It's dangerous after all.
There's no way you can hijack a certain A country's military satellites that easily.
Yeah, that's right. It can't be that easy.
 Hey, isn't this dangerous?

There's no way you can hijack a certain A country's military satellites that easily.
Yeah, that's right. It can't be that easy.
I think this is dangerous, but...
There's no way you can hijack a certain country's military satellites that easily.
Hey, it looks like it's been hijacked...
It looks like it's been hijacked...
What should I do….
Really, I think I've been hijacked.
Who created this program?
I wonder who it is...?
Liar. It's hijacked, isn't it?
Ha, ha, ha... It looks like it's been hijacked...
What should I do…. I made a hole like this...
Liar. Don't say anything unreliable.
sorry….
What should I do?
Gargantua. what happened?
I'm not confident about caricatures...
It's okay, don't worry. Because you're better than me
yes? Somehow, I feel like I'm a little more confident.
What a caricature, I'm not confident.
All right. Gargantua is good, so you can be confident.
I'm glad. Shall we take it seriously?
Oh, take it seriously.
Thank you. You seem to have gained confidence.
What a portrait I'm not confident.
All right. Gargantua is good at drawing, so you can be confident.
But I'm not good at portraits.
It's okay. Me too, Because I draw a portrait.
That's right. Thank you. I got some confidence.
Haha, a caricature...
Was Gargantua good at caricatures?
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥. Then I can't sigh.
Was good. With great success...
For real. Everyone was happy.
Thanks to you, I think I managed.
No no, you're welcome.
It had a bad reputation...
For real…. I thought you'd be a little more happy, but...
Disappointing...
I agree….
It was a huge success.
For real. everyone was happy
If this is the case, you can do it every year.
agree.
It got a bad reputation...
For real…. I thought you'd be a little more happy, but...
Next year, I have to improve my drawing skills a little more.
I agree….
Was good…. A lot of people came.
For real. everyone was happy
It would be better without you...
e? did you say something?
Separately….
It got a bad reputation...
For real…. I thought you'd be a little more happy, but...
Who do you think is to blame?
e? did you say something?
Separately….
Today's public drawing was a nude drawing...
that? I did not know?
I didn't know What I thought was a plaster statue.
But it's better than male nudity.
Shame on you if you're a man...
That's fine.
But I don't really want to see it...
What?
I have to prepare too...
Yes, I ran away.
Today's public drawing was a nude drawing.
that? I did not know?
I didn't know I thought it was a plaster statue.
But it's better than male nudity.
If I were a man, I would be too embarrassed to draw. Because I can't watch...
That's fine.
that's right, but…. Don't make the model feel weird.
I won't do that.
Today's public drawing was a nude drawing.

That's right, but...
That's fine.
I don't think there is such a thing...
Today was a nude drawing...
that? I did not know?
That's why the boys were so excited. I'm tired of it.
‥‥‥‥. (I have no words to return.)
What do you think art is?
‥‥‥‥.
I really like oil paintings, so I was very passionate about my work.
Good thing Gargantua is... I'm no good at oil painting, so I'm not confident.
okay, be confident... At least I have one fan.
eh, mine? Who, who?
It doesn't matter who you are... Let's do our best together.
Who the hell are you?
I like oil paintings, so I was very passionate about my work.
Good thing Gargantua is... I'm no good at oil painting, so I'm not confident.
If you work hard to create a work, no one will disparage it.
I certainly tried my best to draw it, but...
People who disparage such works don't know what real art is. Be confident.
Is that so? When you say so, I'm happy.
It's the last cultural festival. Let's do our best together.

Did you get an oil painting?
I was able to do it, but... I have no confidence in oil painting.
yes? Then decorate it there.
‥‥‥. yes….
It turned out to be a fitting exhibition for the final year.
Exactly, I wonder if it's the beauty of the end.
Was good. Now I can retire in peace.
People didn't really see it.
 Gargantua is still good. I was even called a child's doodle.
About the last year, I wanted to be evaluated a little better.
It was a picture that I tried my best to draw...
People didn't really see it.

I can quit the department now. It's hard because I've had people I don't like.
‥‥‥‥.
Not many people came.
Gargantua is still good. I was even called a child's doodle.
Because it's not.
‥‥‥‥.

The audience seems to have enjoyed it.
Was good. It was worth the effort.
I hope next year will be like this.

Somehow, the audience seemed bored.
Maybe the theme was wrong.
Maybe so, but... Let's try to play better next year.
agree.
Phew, looks like it went well...
The customer was happy.
I can't even taste my joy here.
‥‥‥‥.
Alas, it didn't work...
Maybe the theme was wrong.
I think it's because of someone's playing...
‥‥‥‥.
The audience seemed to enjoy it.

It's the last announcement, and it's a great ending.
agree.
Somehow, the audience seemed bored.
It was the last announcement, but somehow I regret it...
Well…. I should have practiced more...
sorry…. It's my fault
Don't say that. It's no one's fault.
Thank you. Thank you for taking care of me...
Phew, looks like it went well...
The customer was happy.
After the last announcement, I'm immersed in my own world...
‥‥‥‥.
Alas, it didn't work...
Maybe I didn't practice enough...
Already. Do as good as your last announcement.

Gargantua is missing. I can't help it, can I read the composition by myself?
I looked around the exhibits.

It looks like the play is about to begin.
Was funny?
It was great.
Shall we go home soon?
Yes.
The science department seems to be doing an experiment show.
It's just about to begin.

It looks like it exploded, but is he okay...?
From the looks of it, it seemed to be fine.
That's right. It's okay
Shall we go home soon?

‥‥‥‥. It was amazing.
Certainly, today was amazing...
Who made this machine?
Someone from the science department. on second thoughts.
That's right. It's decided.
Well then, let's go home soon.
yes. Well, let's go home.
Hey, that was amazing.
It's too amazing...
By the way, who made this machine?

The cyber club seems to be doing computer fortune-telling.
Let's do a fortune-telling together.
Eh, what should I do... Well…. yeah, that's fine.
Was good…. They go well together.
This fortune telling is right.
I wonder if it's something like this.
It's normal.
I wonder if we are incompatible.
This fortune-telling will surely not come true.
I believe only good things in fortune-telling.
That's good. Shall we go home soon?
Yeah, let's go home

agree.
The cyber club looks like an exhibition of computer games.
Why not try Gargantua?
can't do it. Hey, let me see...
All right, let's try it.
Great, you're good at it.
It was pretty easy.
‥‥‥‥. hey what happened?
This is quite difficult.
Are you not doing it anymore?
Let's go home soon.
‥‥‥. yeah, yeah
The cyber department looks like an exhibition of computer games.
Why not try Gargantua?
I will refrain. Hey, let me see.
All right, let's try it.
I'm good at it.
It was pretty easy.
can i do it too
Do it.
But I'll stop doing it anyway.
oh yeah...
You're not very good at it.
It was quite difficult.
I'm glad I avoided it after all.
I wish I had tried.
Let's go home soon.
agree.

It was quite difficult.
Well then, let's go home soon.
agree.
The cyber department seems to be doing an experimental show.
It's just about to begin.
Hey, hacking is breaking into another computer without permission.
That's right.
What computer did you get into?
Well, I'm not sure, but it doesn't look like it's just a computer.
I'm afraid to think about it, so let's go home now.
I agree. go home.

You must be an amazing person to create such a program.
I don't think that's the problem...
It looks like it's over, so let's go home soon.
agree.
The art club seems to draw portraits.
Gargantua, why don't you draw it?
yeah, yeah I'll get you a drawing.
・ ・ ・
how was the caricature?
Because it's not something to show people...
Hiding it makes me want to see it even more.
yes…. But, after all, it's embarrassing, so it's no good.
yes…. That's fine.
sorry.
Shall we go home soon?
Yeah, let's go home
It seems that the art club will draw a portrait for you.
Gargantua, why don't you draw it?
Yes. I wonder if I'll come and get a drawing.
・ ・ ・
how was the caricature?
I had him draw it, but it didn't look like it, so I gave up...
yes…. It was a pity.
I don't mind. I didn't want it.
 yes. Shall we go home soon?
yeah, yeah Let's go home.
It looks like the art club will draw a portrait for you.
Gargantua, why don't you draw it?
I'm fine I don't like having someone draw it for me.
yes? That's fine.
It's still early, but let's go home already.
Well, if you don't want me to draw your portrait, let's go home.
The art department is...
what happened? Gargantua.
No good! Come over here.
Eh, why?
I'm begging you, can we go home?
Eh, you didn't see anything?
‥‥‥‥. Well, if Gargantua says so.
All right, let's go home.
Was good…. I'm sorry, I was being selfish...
no problem.
Look sideways and take a look. Indeed, Gargantua hides it.
The art department is...
what happened? Gargantua.
It's nothing. Let's go home now.
Eh, are you going home without seeing anything?
All right, let's go home.
understood. bye.
Let's go then.
Look sideways and take a look. Indeed, Gargantua hides it.
The art department is...
what happened? Gargantua.
I'll go home first.
Eh, why?
I don't think I'm coming.
Oh wait.
I see, so that's what it is.
The art club seems to be holding an exhibition of oil paintings.
It's true, it's decorated a lot.
Let's take it slow.
All the pictures are wonderful...
 For real. I liked every picture.
That's right. Good for you.
I especially liked that picture.
What is that picture?
It's a picture of a lone girl looking at the rain with a sad expression on her face.
Oh, that's right.
She's looking at two lovers with one umbrella. You know, that feeling...
Shall we go home soon?
Hey, can you take it easy a little longer?
I agree. Let's take a closer look.
yes.

I agree. I liked every picture.
Heh, I can't believe I understand the goodness of the picture, I've reviewed it.
Even I know the picture.
People grow up.
That's right. Good for you.
You don't understand, do you?
Actually yes.
It's the same as it used to be.
Shall we go home soon?
Yes. Let's go home.
It looks like it's about to start playing.
It looks like it's about to start playing.
It looks like it's about to start playing.
Hey, just now, what song was it?
Gladius, right? It's game music.
It's game music...
It's my favorite song
I thought it was a good song too.
That's good. Shall we go home soon?
‥‥‥. yeah, yeah

I know you very well. What about game music?
It's my favorite song
Was it so. Shall we go home now?
agree.
Hey, was this song funny? I couldn't help but laugh...
I laughed out loud.
But I also wanted to hear a proper song.
I agree. Shall we go home soon?
‥‥‥. yeah, yeah
Hey, was this song funny?
love funny songs like this.
But I also wanted to hear a proper song.
I agree. Shall we go home soon?
yeah, yeah Let's go home.
The current song is good, but I also wanted to hear a proper song.
yes? I love funny songs like this.
I see. Well then, let's go home soon.
agree.
Classic is good.
I agree. It was a good performance.
That's right. Good for you...
I felt like I was drawn into the world of music just by listening to it.
You seem to like it.
Yeah, because it was so good...
Shall we go home soon?
‥‥‥. yeah, yeah
Classic is good.
I agree. It was a good performance.
It felt like each sound was etched into my heart.
You seem to like it.
I really liked it.
That's right. Good for you...
Was it really good?
Good for you.
It's kind of suspicious.
Shall we go home soon?
yeah, yeah Let's go home.
Classic is good.
Let's go home soon.
agree.
Together with Shiori, I looked around the exhibits.
All right, it's a folk dance. Perfect, I'll do it.
・ ・ ・
All right, next is Gargantua.
Folk dance too It's not like I threw it away.
Oh no. The song is over.
I wish Gargantua didn't have to leave so quickly...
Ah…. With you...?
Nice to meet you.
‥‥‥‥.
Thank you very much.
thank you.
‥‥‥‥.
It's rare to be touched by me.
do you like this
That's fine, let's end it here.
Oh, I'm on my way home.
let's dance. Come on, let's dance.
Hi. This time, with you.
Oh my god! I'm not lucky.
glad….
Come on, let's dance.
Ah, nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.
I heard you are very good at it...
Yo-ro-shoku-…
Ah, it's time for the next person.
thank you.
Don't laugh when you fail.
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
‥‥‥‥.
I was waiting for your turn.
Pantagruelle. I'm lucky.
Please don't touch me too much!
Hey, can we have a butch together?
I wish I could do something more interesting.
Boo~, ….
Ah, um..., um...
Thank you very much.
‥‥‥‥.
Pantagruelle, I've come to this circle because I want to dance with you.
Pantagruelle. Hey, why are you here?
Gargantua, you seem to be in the wrong column.
Ah, Yumi, I made a mistake in the line.
After dancing, it's okay to go back...
- Nice to meet you Mysterious Woman.
- Nice to meet you Mysterious Woman.
- Nice to meet you Mysterious Woman.
All right, it's a folk dance. Perfect, I'll do it.
・ ・ ・
Next... That's a girl I don't know.
All right, it's a folk dance. Perfect, I'll do it.
・ ・ ・
Next... Huh, that hairstyle...?
- Mysterious woman Ah, song... It's over.
It was a bit of a shame.
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
Oh? Did I mix the medicine wrong?
Gargantua made this morning's meal... what did you put in
I wonder where I went wrong. for valuable research. Endure.
no more. When it's Gargantua's turn, it's okay to skip meals...
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua can't complain because it's scary.
You said you were going to test your courage today.
>Male and female managers draw lots and pair up with people with the same number.
My partner is the 15th girl. what kind of girl
You are number 15.
Ah, that's right.
I'm Yuina Himoo.
Ah, I'm Pantagruelle. nice to meet you.
I'm kind of scared...
Looks like it's our turn next. Well then, let's go.
Yes.
It's pretty creepy.
where?
e? Aren't you afraid of Gargantua?
I'm not scared at all.
It might be a ghost or something.
Are you stupid? There's no way ghosts are such unscientific things.
Oh yeah.
It's okay to be scared or scared...
Come on, let's go.
Yes.
I'm not on it.
Thus ended the test of courage.
I got to know Gargantua, but I wonder if future club activities will be fun...
How about the science department?
I'm glad I entered the science department, but what should I study first?
Did you learn how to handle lab equipment?
Really. If you don't remember how to use the equipment, it will lead to an accident.
If you get hurt in a silly experiment, you're an idiot.
Well then, I guess I'll ask Gargantua to teach me.
Well, if it's just a little, you can tell me.
Well then, please.
Please, I will.
yes…. Please.
How about the science department?
I'm glad I entered the science department, but what should I study first?
Make sure you know how to handle your equipment.
I agree. I'll do that first.
I would be in trouble if I got involved in a silly experiment.
Well then, let Gargantua teach you.
Remember yourself.
‥‥‥‥.
How about the science department?
I'm glad I entered the science department, but what should I study first?
You must have memorized how to handle laboratory equipment.
I agree. I'll do that first.
Remember it. I hate being involved in an accident.
Ah, Gargantua. What should I study from?
‥‥‥‥. Even though I don't know how to use lab equipment.
Well, how to use the experimental equipment...
Ah, Gargantua. I'm in trouble because my experiments keep failing.
How could an experiment like this fail? It's strange.
uh, right?
Well, it can't be helped, but please investigate the cause of the failure.
That's true too. Is it the reason for the failure?
Making the same mistake twice is proof that you're a fool.
That's right. Thank you.
Ah, Gargantua. I'm in trouble because my experiments keep failing.
You're a fool to make the same mistake twice or three times.
Yeah, but...
Did you try to find out why it failed?
Really. The reason why I failed...
If that doesn't work, you're not talented.
That's right. Thank you. Gargantua.
Ah, Gargantua. I'm in trouble because my experiments keep failing.
In such a boring experiment, you can often fail.
Well, even if you say that...
You'll soon find out what caused the failure.
No. Is it the reason for the failure? do you want to check it out?
You don't have to do anything useless.
Ah, Gargantua. I'm in trouble because my experiments keep failing.
‥‥‥‥‥. Even though I didn't investigate the cause of the failure...
Is that the reason for the failure...
Ah, Gargantua. Recently, I've grown tired of the experiments in the books...
did you still do that? Why don't you have your own theme?
Theme or... What do you like?
If so, would you like to do a joint experiment with me?
No. I will refrain from doing so.
yes. Then why don't you use your head and think about it?
That's right. Thank you. I'm motivated.
Ah, Gargantua. Recently, I've grown tired of the experiments in the books...
I'm sure that kind of experiment will be boring. What if I decide on a theme?
Theme or... What do you like?
There's something I want to make weapons, I want to make weapons.
Gargantua. It's the same for both...
Noisy. Then just think about it.
Thank you. I'll do so.
Ah, Gargantua. Recently, I've grown tired of the experiments in the books...
Have you done that kind of experiment yet? Have a theme.
Theme or... What do you like?
think for yourself I've decided that I can't do more research than I do.
That's right. What should I do...
 Ah, Gargantua. Recently, I've grown tired of the experiments in the books...
‥‥‥‥‥. I haven't decided on a theme yet.
Oh yeah, the theme...
The research I announced yesterday, if it's successful, it's pretty good.
It's a story if it succeeds, but I still don't know what will happen.
Yes. Unsuccessful research is just a waste of time.
For now, I will try my best to succeed.
Well, at least do your best.
The research I announced yesterday, it's not quite.
It's a story if it succeeds, but I still don't know what will happen.
If it's me, a genius, it will be soon.
uh, right? If so, can you help me?
I hate it I have my hands full with my research.
Oh yeah. Well then, do you want to do your best alone?
Well, at least do your best.
The research I announced yesterday, it's not quite.
It's a story if it succeeds, but I still don't know what will happen.
Well, at least do your best.
I'll try my best.
Ah, Gargantua. What did you think of the research we published yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. If successful, isn't it hard?
If I succeed... you're right….
What do you think of the research we published yesterday? Do you think you will succeed?
One more step, and it looks like it's going to be successful.
Of course. Are you aiming for the Nobel Prize?
There is no way a high school student can win such an award.
If you succeed, you can get it. Only if I succeed.
I don't know if I can win the prize, but I'll try my best.
yes. Well, at least do your best.
Is the research you announced yesterday going to be successful?
Just one more step and it looks like it will be successful.
Of course you should win the Nobel Prize.
There is no way a high school student can win such an award.
yes. It's such a boring study.
I don't know if it's boring or not, but I'm going to make it a success.
yes. Well, at least do your best.
Is the research you announced yesterday going to be successful?
Just one more step and it looks like it will be successful.
Of course you should win the Nobel Prize.
There is no way a high school student can win such an award.
yes. At least don't fail.
I will do my best to make it a success.
Ah, Gargantua. What do you think of the research we published yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. What if I get an award?
I wish I could win a Nobel Prize...
What about the cyber department?
I'm glad I joined the Cyber Club, but I can't handle computers very well...
Are you familiar with the keyboard?
keyboard…? No, not yet...
Then when you start
good advice thank you I'll do my best from now on.
Well, at least do your best.
What about the cyber department?
I'm glad I joined the Cyber Club, but I can't handle computers very well...
Are you familiar with the keyboard?
keyboard…? No, not yet...
Then it's out of the question.
That's right. Then I'll try.
Well, at least do your best.
What about the cyber department?
I'm glad I joined the Cyber Club, but I can't handle computers very well...
After getting used to the keyboard?
keyboard…? That's right.
Well, at least do your best.
Ah, Gargantua. My computer can't handle it well.
‥‥‥‥‥. Even though I'm not used to the keyboard.
I wonder if I'll get used to the keyboard...
Did you make a program?
No, I can't come up with a good algorithm.
You think you should just study computers, don't you?
Oh, is that no good?
Therefore, ordinary people are useless. Study mathematics, physics, and various other things.
A lot of things...
There is also a way to analyze other people's programs.
Is it a program analysis? Let's analyze Gargantua.
If you can analyze it, please do so.
If you can analyze it...?
Well, at least do your best.
Did you make a program?
No, I can't come up with a good algorithm.
Study mathematics and physics well.
Is that so?
If you don't have pride, why don't you refer to other people's programs?
Is it a program analysis? Can I analyze Gargantua's?
If you can analyze it, that's fine. if you can analyze it.
If you can analyze it...?
Well, at least do your best.
Are you ready to program?
No, I can't come up with a good algorithm.
If you don't have pride, analyze other people's programs too.
Is it a program analysis? Can I analyze Gargantua's?
If you can Just do your best.
Ah, Gargantua. I can't come up with a good algorithm.
‥‥‥‥‥. I like analyzing programs.
That's right, program analysis huh...
I was shown the software I received yesterday.
I'm not very confident, how was it?
Not at all.
Where did you go?
What stood out the most was how difficult it was to use.
I didn't think about the people who would use it... I will try to recreate it.
Well, at least do your best.
I was shown the software I received yesterday.
I'm not very confident, how was it?
Not at all. It was hard to use and I had no choice.
I didn't think about the people who would use it...
People who only think about themselves are like this.
That's right.
I didn't expect Gargantua to tell me...
Well, at least do your best.
I was shown the software I received yesterday.
I'm not very confident, how was it?
Not at all. It was hard to use and I had no choice.
I didn't think about the people who would use it...
Well, at least do your best.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you see the software I gave you yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. It was hard to use and I had no choice.
Right, I didn't think about the person who used it.
I was shown the software I received yesterday.
Well done, right?
So-so. For ordinary people, this is enough.
Thank you. I'm thinking of making an original OS this time.
Make what you like.
If possible, help Gargantua...
I'm sorry, but it's not something a genius makes. Do your best alone.
I saw the software you gave me yesterday.
Well done, right?
So-so. For ordinary people, this is enough.
Thank you. I'm thinking of making an original OS this time.
That much suits you. Good luck.
I saw the software you gave me yesterday.
Well done, right?
So-so.
From Gargantua's point of view, I wonder if that's the case...
Do your best.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you see the software I gave you yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. So-so.
Gargantua says it's okay, so that's good.
The software you announced yesterday is pretty good for an average person.
Well done, right?
After all, you're at the level of an ordinary person, so a game contest would be just right.
Is it a game contest? But I'm sure I'll fail in the first round...
It's a different story for a genius like me to apply, but this is enough.
I guess so. Well then, maybe I'll try to fix it.
Well, at least do your best.
The software you announced yesterday is pretty good for an average person.
Well done, right?
At this level, a game contest would be just right.
Even if I apply, I will fail in the first selection, I'm sure...
Yes. It's useless without ambition.
Well then, I'll try to fix it.
Well, at least do your best.
The software you announced yesterday is pretty good for an average person.
Well done, right?
Win the grand prize in a game contest and then brag about it.
Even if I apply, I think I will fail in the first screening...
Yes, it is impossible for those who give up from the beginning. Excuse me then.
That's right, let's do our best.
Ah, Gargantua. How was the software announced yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. Game contest level.
That's right. do you want to try
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
Sorry everyone.
Gargantua, did you make this morning's meal?
It smelled a little, but I thought it would be fine if I put it on fire.
Hey, hey, I can't put that in! Ugh, it hurts...
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua doesn't seem to mind too much.
You said you were going to test your courage today.
>Male and female managers draw lots and pair up with people with the same number.
My partner is the 15th girl. what kind of girl
Hey you. You are number 15.
Ah, that's right.
I am Ayako Katagiri. Nice to meet you.
Oh, I'm Frederique. nice to meet you too. (She's like a fake foreigner.)
Looks like it's our turn next. Well then, let's go.
Oh yeah. let's go.
It's pretty creepy.
Kyaa.
Oops. What's wrong? Gargantua.
Didn't you hear something just now?
Noise? I didn't notice. Isn't that the sound of the wind?
eh? It really is the sound of the wind. Oh, I'm relieved.
Gargantua, you're pretty scared.
After all, this kind of thing scares me.
That's no surprise.
So let's go early
Oh, okay
Thus ended the test of courage.
Now that I got to know Gargantua, my future club activities will be even more fun.
Ah, Gargantua. About the picture I drew yesterday, what can I do to improve it?
For the time being, how about practicing to capture the shape well?
Good shape... I really have to draw it over and over again...
You have a good taste, so I think you'll be good at it soon.
uh, right? Thank you. I wonder if I'll cheer up.
Well then, never give up. good luck.
Ah, Gargantua. About the picture I drew yesterday, what can I do to improve it?
For now, how about practicing to capture the shape well?
Good shape... I really have to draw it over and over again...
Yes. It's just a matter of trying many times.
Well then, I wonder if I'll be RIP.
never give up. good luck.
Ah, Gargantua. About the picture I drew yesterday, what can I do to improve it?
For now, how about practicing to capture the shape well?
Good shape... I really have to draw it over and over again...
Good luck with that.
Ah, Gargantua. About the picture I drew yesterday, what can I do to improve it?
‥‥‥‥‥. Capture the shape well Why don't you practice?
I see, the shape is good...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture I drew yesterday, I just showed it to you.
How was it? Do you have any advice for me?
Hmm. I think you should pay more attention to shadows when drawing.
Watch out for shadows... I'll try my best
You've got really good taste, so you'll be able to draw good pictures in no time.
uh, right? Thank you.
Well then, never give up. good luck.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture I drew yesterday, I just showed it to you.
How was it? Do you have any advice for me?
It would be better if you drew a little more attention to shadows.
Watch out for shadows... I'll try my best
I'm pretty confident about that. Use it as a reference if you like.
Thank you. I will use it as a reference.
Well then, never give up. good luck.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture I drew yesterday, I just showed it to you.
How was it? Do you have any advice for me?
I think it would be better if you paid more attention to shadows.
Pay attention to shadows... I'll try my best
Good luck with that.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you see the picture I drew yesterday?
Hmm,‥‥‥‥‥. Why don't you pay attention to shadows?
Yes, shadows...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture I drew yesterday, I just showed it to you.
How was it? Do you have any advice for me?
It would be best if we tweaked the composition a little more.
OK, it's a scheme. Think about it and try drawing it...
I'm pretty good sense, so I'm going to be overtaken soon.
It's not like that, Not yet.
Well then, never give up. good luck.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture I drew yesterday, I just showed it to you.
How was it? Do you have any advice for me?
I think it would be better if the composition was a little more ingenious.
OK, it's a scheme. Do you want to try and draw it?
Try drawing a lot and practice.
Thank you. I'll do some research soon.
Good luck with that.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture I drew yesterday, I just showed it to you.
How was it? Do you have any advice for me?
It's better if you devise a little more in how to take the composition.
OK, it's a scheme. Think about it and try drawing it...
Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you see the picture I drew yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. Take care of the composition Why don't you draw it?
That's right, the composition huh...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture you drew the other day, it's wonderful.
I guess. I'm pretty confident about this painting.
It would be perfect if I could establish my own painting style.
For now, I think I'll apply to some kind of exhibition...
I think it's a bit reckless, but it might be nice to try it once.
If Gargantua says so, I'll wait and see.
think that's the best. Good luck with that. I'm rooting for you too.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture you drew the other day, it's wonderful.
I guess. I'm pretty confident about this painting.
It would be perfect if I could establish my own painting style.
In the meantime, I think I'll apply to some exhibition.
I think the exhibition is still reckless.
Shall we raise our arms a little longer then?
That's good. Good luck then.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The picture you drew the other day, it's wonderful.
I guess. I'm pretty confident about this painting.
It would be great if you could establish your own painting style.
In the meantime, I think I'll apply to some exhibition.
think it's reckless. Take it easy. Take it easy.
That's right. Don't be impatient, do your best.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you see the picture I drew the other day?
‥‥‥‥‥. What if you had your own painting style?
That's right, my picture...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Is the picture you drew last time finished?
not yet. It's due to be completed soon.
Are you going to exhibit that painting at the exhibition?
That's what I'm going to do, but I'm a little worried if it's okay.
Don Wally. Don't worry. You have to be confident.
Thank you. Gargantua. I'm fine.
Don't let your guard down until the end Do your best.
All right, let's do our best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Is the picture you drew last time finished?
not yet. It's due to be completed soon.
Are you going to exhibit that painting at the exhibition?
That's what I'm going to do, but I'm a little worried if it's okay.
Take it easy, take it easy. It'll work out.
It's pretty sloppy, but I've gained confidence.
That's right. Don't let your guard down until the end, do your best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Is the picture you drew last time finished?
not yet. It's due to be completed soon.
Are you going to exhibit that painting at the exhibition?
That's what I intend to do.
Good luck with that. I'm rooting for you too.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you see the picture I drew the other day?
‥‥‥‥‥. Hmm. Are you going to exhibit at an exhibition?
Shall we fix it a little more...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
How about the brass band?
Joining the brass band club is good, but where should I start?
Anyway, have you learned to read sheet music?
That's what it is yet. Gargantua should tell me.
Oh, it's fine. But my way of teaching is not kind.
No, just being told by Gargantua is enough.
yes. That's fine.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
How about the brass band?
Joining the brass band club is good, but where should I start?
Anyway, have you learned to read sheet music?
That's what it is yet. Gargantua should tell me.
It's fine, but my teaching method is strict.
Like hitting with a whip.
yes. I won't call you Queen...that's what I do.
Well, for now, tell me kindly.
Yes. I'll teach you the hardest thing ever.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
How about the brass band?
Joining the brass band club is good, but where should I start?
For now, have you learned to read sheet music?
That's what it is yet.
Then you have to study. Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. I don't know what to start with...
‥‥‥‥‥. Even though I can't read sheet music.
Yes, sheet music...
Ah, Gargantua. I'm not very good at playing...
I think it's useless if you don't practice it over and over again.
As it is, I'm going to practice.
I think it's useless if you don't check the bad parts of your performance.
That's right. Take care and practice.
You've got good sense, so you'll improve quickly.
Thank you. Gargantua.
Ah, Gargantua. I'm not very good at playing...
You have to practice it over and over again.
As it is, I'm going to practice.
I have to check the bad points during practice and fix them.
Really. Be careful from now on Let's practice.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Ah, Gargantua. I'm not very good at playing...
It's just practice.
For the time being, I'm going to practice.
If you practice without rushing, you'll improve sooner or later.
That's right. I wonder if it can't be helped if I get impatient...
Ah, Gargantua. I'm not very good at playing...
‥‥‥‥‥. I'm out of practice.
I wonder if it is.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yesterday's performance was pretty good.
yes? But still. I have to practice more.
Practice is important, but I think it's better to practice more casually.
Since it's a big deal, I'd like to play at least as well as Gargantua.
Not so good.
I agree. Exactly so.
Come on, deny it there.
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yesterday's performance was pretty good.
yes? But still. I have to practice more.
Take it easy. Let's take it easy.
Since it's a big deal, I'd like to play at least as well as Gargantua.
Ahahahaha. It'll take a lifetime. Ahahahaha.
I'll overtake you in no time.
That's hard. Don't let me catch up I have to do my best.
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yesterday's performance was pretty good.
yes? But still. I have to practice more.
Even if you practice so hard, it's not always possible to become good at it.
I want to play at least as well as Gargantua.
If so, I have to practice until I die.
I agree. Exactly so.
Ahahahaha. I have to do my best not to be overtaken.
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Gargantua. How was your performance yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. So-so.
Well, I have to practice a little more.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yesterday's performance was good.
yes? By this time, I was feeling a little more confident.
Already solo part It seems okay.
For now. By the way, don't you want to participate in the international brass band contest?
If possible, I'd like to go out with you.
I think it's still a bit impossible with our ability, but if we try hard, we'll be able to do it somehow.
I have to do my best.
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yesterday's performance Good, good.
yes? By this time, I was feeling a little more confident.
Already a solo part I'm fine.
For now. By the way, wouldn't you like to participate in an international brass band contest?
Come to think of it, there was something like that too.
I think it's a little impossible with our current ability, but if we try hard, we'll be able to do it somehow.
Will you do your best?
each other.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yesterday's performance was good.
yes? By this time, I was feeling a little more confident.
You've improved quite a bit.
I think it's a bit impossible with our current ability, but wouldn't you like to participate in the international brass band contest?
There was such a thing.
Let's do our best so that we can participate.
Ah, Gargantua. How was your performance yesterday? .
‥‥‥‥‥. Pretty good, isn't it?
I'm getting more and more confident.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
I heard that you are going to study in Vienna.
Eh, I don't know. Where does that story come from?
What a good It's a hoax.
Look, rather than talking about that, you might be able to participate in the international brass band contest, so let's practice.
Yes. I want to do my best to participate.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
I heard that you are going to study in Vienna.
Eh, I don't know. Where does that story come from?
what a hoax
Look, rather than talking about that, you might be able to participate in the international brass band contest, so let's practice.
Yes. There was an event like that too.
To compete, practice, practice.
Would you like to try a little harder?
Ah, Pantagruelle.
I heard that you are going to study in Vienna.
Eh, I don't know. Where does that story come from?
what are you not going
Look, rather than talking about that, you might be able to participate in the international brass band contest, so let's practice.
Yes, there was such a thing.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you hear the rumor about me?
‥‥‥‥‥. Are you going to study in Vienna?
Exactly where did that story come from...
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
Me…. How should I apologize...
Gargantua, did you make this morning's meal?
I'm sorry, everyone. really sorry….
No more practice today. But it hurts...
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua seems to have recovered.
You said you were going to test your courage today.
>Male and female managers draw lots and pair up with people with the same number.
My partner is the 15th girl. what kind of girl
Um... are you number 15?
Ah, that's right.
Good thing I found it. My name is Mio Kisaragi. thank you.
Oh, I'm Frederique. nice to meet you too. (She is a quiet girl.)
Looks like it's our turn next. Well then, let's go.
Yes.
It's pretty creepy.
Kyaa.
Oops. What's wrong? Gargantua.
Now, I hear something...
eh? Noise? Nothing but...
Eh, but... See... See you again!
Ahh. That's the sound of the wind. It's okay let's go
But I'm still scared... Can I walk a little closer?
Of course, yes. (I'm lucky.)
Thus ended the test of courage.
Now that I got to know Gargantua, my future club activities will be even more fun.
Ah, Pantagruelle
How about the Literary Club?
I'm glad I joined the literature club, but writing sentences is quite difficult.
I think it's good to read various books, but...
Well, let's start by reading more books.
I'll bring you a book next time, so if you don't mind, please read it.
Thank you. I can help you.
Ah, Pantagruelle
how is it? Literary department.
I'm glad I joined the literature club, but writing sentences is quite difficult.
Unless you read a lot of books, I think it will be difficult.
Well, let's start by reading more books.
If the book I have is fine, I'll bring it next time.
Thank you. I can help you.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
I'm glad I joined the literature club, but writing sentences is quite difficult.
I think it's good to read a lot of books and study.
Should I start by reading more books?
Writing sentences is quite difficult. what should i do?
‥‥‥‥‥. If you don't read the book and study...
Well, let's start by reading more books.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The short story I wrote yesterday, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm not sure, but can you criticize me?
It was good, but I thought it would have been better if the writing was a little easier to understand.
Yes, it's an easy sentence, isn't it? Thank you Gargantua.
sorry. It sounds like you said something great...
No way. Thank you for your honest criticism.
Is that so? Good luck then.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The short story I wrote yesterday, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm not sure, but can you criticize me?
is that so…. I think it would have been better if the text was a little clearer.
Yes, it's an easy sentence, isn't it? Thank you Gargantua.
No. I can only help you with something like this.
Well then, why don't you study the easy-to-understand sentences?
Please do your best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The short story I wrote yesterday, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm not sure, but can you criticize me?
is that so…. I think it would be nice if the text was a little clearer.
Yes, it's an easy sentence, isn't it? Thank you Gargantua.
Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you read the short story I wrote yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. I don't think I'm thinking about the people who read it.
Did that sentence not make sense to you? Do you want to do some more research?
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm not sure, but can you criticize me?
I thought the story itself was interesting, but...
but…?
I can't see what you want to say... I'm sorry.
No, thank you. Theme huh... I didn't really think about it.
Really….
For now, let's write with justice, friendship, and love.
Good luck then.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm not sure, but can you criticize me?

sorry. Even I can't write that much...
No, thank you. I'll try to write again.
Please do your best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm not sure, but can you criticize me?
I thought it was interesting, but I couldn't really see the theme.
Theme huh? I'll try my best. Thank you Gargantua.
Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you read the novel I wrote the other day?
‥‥‥‥‥. What did you want to say in that novel?
what do you mean... I didn't have a theme...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm pretty confident.
Really it was interesting. I would love to write something like that too.
No no. Still nowhere near Gargantua.
That's not it. Please let me read your next work as well.
Of course. I'm going to ask you to read it first.
really? I am very happy.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm pretty confident.
It's great. I wish I could write like that...
No, not at all. But it was good. I hope you like it.
Please let me read your next work as well.
Of course. I want you to read it first.
really? Well then, I'm looking forward to it.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
How was it? I'm pretty confident.
Really it was interesting. I thought it was a good piece.
uh, right? Thank you.
I'm also looking forward to your next work.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you read the novel I wrote the other day?
‥‥‥‥‥. I think it was interesting.
That's right. In spite of that, you look boring...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
how was it? I'm pretty confident.
It was a wonderful piece. I'm already impressed...
yes? Thank you. I really like it.
How about applying for the next Ueki Prize?
A plant award? I don't think it's that level.
don't think so.
Well then, I'll try my best.
Please do your best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
how was it? I'm pretty confident.
It was a great piece. He's already a fine writer.
Well, that's too much of an honor. Well, I really like it myself.
I think you should apply for the next Ueki Prize.
A plant award? If that's all you're saying, maybe I should apply.
Please do your best. I'm rooting for you.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
The novel I wrote last time, I was able to read it.
how was it? I'm pretty confident.
Great work, isn't it? It doesn't look like a high school student's work.
Well, that's too much of an honor. Well, I really like it myself.
I think I should definitely apply for the Ueki Prize this time, but...
A plant award? If that's all you're saying, maybe I should apply.
Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. Did you read the novel I wrote the other day?
‥‥‥‥‥. How about applying for the Ueki Prize?
A plant award? Should I apply?
Ah, Pantagruelle
How's your practice going?
I'm glad I joined the theater club, but theater is quite difficult.
I think so, too. That's why I'm currently focusing on vocal practice.
yeah, i should do that too
Then why not practice together?
yeah, shall we?
Was good…. Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle
How's your practice going?
I'm glad I joined the theater club, but theater is quite difficult.

agree. Shall I do that too?
Good luck then.
Theater is very difficult. what should i do?
‥‥‥‥‥. I'm practicing my pronunciation, but...
That's right, vocal practice...
Ah, Gargantua. I can't act well, is there a better way?
I try to learn by watching other people's acting, but...
I see, so you learn by watching other people's performances...
sorry. That's not a good way...
No, I'll try that too. Thank you Gargantua.
Was good…. Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. I can't act well, what should I do?
is that so…. I watch people act and study.
Do you want to study human acting? Thank you, it was helpful.
I really don't know if that's okay, but...
No, it was very helpful. Thank you Gargantua.
you're welcome. Let's do our best together.
Ah, Gargantua. I can't act well, what should I do?
I try to learn by watching other people's acting, but...
Is it someone else's performance? Thank you, it was helpful.
Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. I can't act well, what should I do?
‥‥‥‥‥. I use people's acting as a reference.
That's right, it's someone else's acting...
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was very good.
yes? Not yet.
If that's all you can do, I think it's enough.
But Gargantua does a great job, too.
No, not at all. Wow, I'm not at all...
Let's work together to improve our performance.
I agree. let's do our best.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was good.
yes? Not yet.
I think this much is enough.
But Gargantua does a better job.
That's not true. I'm not at all...
If so, let's do our best together.
I agree. Let's do our best.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was good.
yes? Not yet.
I think this is enough, but...
No no. Gargantua I have to do my best...
It's not like that, but Let's do our best together.
Ah, Gargantua. How was my performance yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. I think it's normal.
Yes, it's normal...
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was very good.
It was? I'm pretty confident these days.
I think the emotional expression was especially wonderful.
uh, right? I would be happy if Gargantua praised me.
Anytime is fine, so could you take me to practice?
Such. There's nothing Gargantua can teach you.
Is it useless?
No, it's not bad, but... I don't think there's really anything to teach.
That's okay... Well, then, I'm looking forward to working with you.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was very good.
It was? I'm pretty confident these days.
In particular, I thought the emotional expression was wonderful.
uh, right? But Gargantua's acting is also great.
No. I don't think so...
Anyway, let's do our best together.
I agree. let's do our best.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was very good.
It was? I'm pretty confident these days.
In particular, I thought the emotional expression was wonderful.

I also have to do my best not to lose... So you'll excuse me.
I have to work harder too.
Ah, Gargantua. How was my performance yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. I think it is good!
Well, I'm confident.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was wonderful.
It was? I'm pretty confident these days.
It looks like you will be able to participate in the All Japan Theater Grand Prix.
uh, right? I hope you can get out.
If you do your best, I'm sure the grand prize won't be a dream.
I agree. If we all work hard, we might be able to go.
Let's work together and do our best.
Yeah, let's do our best.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was wonderful.
It was? I'm pretty confident these days.
You might be able to participate in the All Japan Theater Grand Prix.
uh, right? I hope I can participate.
If you do your best, the grand prize is not a dream, I think.
If Gargantua says so, it might work out.
Let's do our best to participate.
Let's do our best.
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yesterday's performance was wonderful.
It was? I'm pretty confident these days.
I feel like I can participate in the All Japan Theater Grand Prix.

I think I can do it if I practice hard, but...
I agree. do you want to try
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Gargantua. How was my performance yesterday?
‥‥‥‥‥. I wonder if I can participate in the All Japan Theater Grand Prix...
I see, the All Japan Theater Grand Prix... I must do my best.
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
Well…. Is it my fault that you are all suffering?
Gargantua made this morning's meal...
I'm sorry. Cooking is something I'm not good at.
Good at it, not good at it, it's not that kind of problem.
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua still doesn't understand what happened yesterday.
Today's practice is very hard... I feel dizzy for some reason...
no more. It is useless.
oh what happened to me...
Hello, are you okay?
is someone calling me
It looks like you've noticed. is it OK?
I've been practicing... I don't remember.
I was so surprised when I collapsed right in front of my eyes.
Ah, you took care of me. Thank you…. Eth….
? ? ?
that…. If you don't mind, could you tell me your name?
Ah yes. you're welcome My name is Koshiki Yukari.
Thank you Gargantua. I'm Frederique.
It sounds like you're okay now. Now let's get back to practice.
yes. Thank you very much.
Gargantua? Was that girl in the same department? But I was pretty blurry.
Pantagruelle. hello. How's your practice going?
It's pretty tight. I can barely keep up.
Really. That seems tough.
Isn't it tighter for girls?
indeed…. I don't think so.
I see.
Well then, I have to go back soon, so I can't go...
Let's do our best together.
I agree. let's do our best.
Pantagruelle. hello. How's your practice going?
It's pretty tight. I can barely keep up.
Really. It's hard, isn't it?
Isn't it tighter for girls?
I agree. What do you think?
Well, even if you ask me that...
Well then, I have to go back soon, so I can't go...
Let's do our best together.
I agree. let's do our best.
Pantagruelle. hello.
Isn't it hard to practice?
Really? I'm laid back, but...
Isn't it tighter for girls?
Is that so? Well then, I'll be back, so...
yes. Good luck then.
excuse me.
Ah, Gargantua. The practice was so hard that I was exhausted.
I agree. Then...
‥‥‥‥.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
Are you in a slump? I wonder what it is...
Gargantua, don't you ever have a bad time?
How are you? Yes, we have it. I often catch colds.
It's not like that, is there a time when everything just doesn't work out?
That's the one who is the one Because it's always a thing.
Is that so?
But at times like that, I heard it's good to go back to the beginning.
Is that so? Should I try again from the basics?
Well then, I have to go back soon, so I can't go...
Well then. Thank you Gargantua. It was helpful.
Reference? ? ? ? ….
…I'm sure you don't understand what I'm saying.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
You can't do that. If so, I have to rest today.
e? rest?
Don't you have a cold?
Ah, it's not about physical condition, it's about tennis.
Ha, is that so? How's your tennis going?
No matter how much I practice, I never get better.
I heard from my father that in such a case, the best thing to do is to go back to the basics...
Is that so? Should I try again from the basics?
Well then, I have to go back soon, so...
Well then. Thank you Gargantua.
excuse me.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
Are you feeling unwell? That's not good.
I'm in trouble. Is there a better way?
I heard from my father that in such a case, the best thing to do is to go back to the basics...
Is that so? Should I try again from the basics?
Well then, I have to go back soon, so...
Well then. Thank you Gargantua.
excuse me.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
What should I do?
If you know that, don't worry.
Pantagruelle. hello. I watched you practice.
how was it? I think I'm improving, but...
That's amazing. I can't keep up.
uh, right? Do you think you can participate in the Inter-High?
indeed. I am sure you will be able to participate.
I do not think so? If I do my best, will I be able to do something?
I think it's ok. Well then, I have to go back soon, so...
Thank you. Well then, do your best.
Pantagruelle. hello. I watched you practice.
how was it? I think I'm improving, but...
That's amazing. I think you are very good at it.
uh, right? Do you think you can participate in the Inter-High?
indeed. I think that if I do my best, I will be able to do something, but...
I do not think so? If I do my best, will I be able to do something?
I think so, but... Well then, I have to go back soon, so...
Thank you. Well then, do your best.
Pantagruelle. hello.
Ah, Gargantua. hello. do you think you're improving?
indeed. I think you are very good at it.
uh, right? Do you think you can participate in the Inter-High?
indeed. I don't know.
Oh yeah. Do you want to do your best for the time being?
Well then, I have to go back soon, so...
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Gargantua. I think I'm improving, but...
I hope I can go to the Inter-High.
Is it inter-high?
Pantagruelle. hello. You're very good at it.
Thank you Gargantua. But still.
Huh? Even if you're that good, what's still there?
It means that there is a higher rank.
Really. It's hard.
But at the Inter-High, I think I'll be able to reach a good point.
Is that so. Good luck then.
Yeah, I'll do my best. Good luck to Gargantua too.
Pantagruelle. hello. You're very good at it.
Thank you Gargantua. But still.
Even if you're that good, is it useless?
It means that there is a higher rank.
Really.
But at the Inter-High, I think I'll be able to reach a good point.
Is that so. Good luck then.
Yeah, I'll do my best. Good luck to Gargantua.
Pantagruelle. hello. You're very good at it.
Thank you Gargantua. But still.
Even if you're that good, what's still going on?
At the Inter-High, it looks like we'll be able to reach a good point.
Good luck then. excuse me.
Ah, Gargantua. Don't you think it's gotten better lately?
I agree. It is good.
All right, I'll do my best.
Pantagruelle. Are you going on a trip to London?
eh? I'm not going. What that?
I heard that you are going to Wimbledon...
It's not a trip, it's a tennis tournament. But I'm not going.
Really. Not a trip, but a tennis tournament?
that's right. It's a dream come true for a tennis player.
Good luck in London.
So don't go.
Well then, I have to go back soon, so I can't go...
Don't listen to me. But I would like to go.
Pantagruelle. Are you going on a trip to Wimbledon?
eh? I'm not going. What that?
Everyone was talking about it, but... Really.
Rather than that, I want to get good grades at the Inter-High.
Really. Are you not going on a trip?
I won't go (From what I heard, it was Wimbledon appearances...)
Well then, I have to go back soon, so I can't go...
Well then.
Pantagruelle. Are you going on a trip to London?
eh? I'm not going. What that?
I heard that you are going to Wimbledon...
It's not a trip, it's a tennis tournament. I won't go.
Really. Good luck in London.
So don't go.
I heard about Wimbledon.
Exactly where did that story come from...
It's nice to travel abroad.
‥‥‥‥.
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
Sorry everyone. Excuse me.
Gargantua made this morning's meal...
See, I don't cook much. No, I think it was bad.
No more practice today. But it hurts...
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua doesn't seem to mind too much.
Today's practice is very hard... I feel dizzy for some reason...
No more.
oh what happened to me...
Come on, wake up.
Bashan
Wow. I can't wait.
It looks like you've finally figured it out.
I've been practicing... I don't remember.
Aren't you weak to be exhausted with this much practice?
You took care of me. Thank you…. Ah, Gargantua.
do you know me
Of course. Everyone in the swimming club knows that. (She is Nozomi Kiyokawa. She is a super high school level female swimmer.)
It's unfair that only you know my name and I don't.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Frederique. nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Well then, after you've had enough rest, come back to practice.
Thank you.
Yay. I just talked to the famous Gargantua. I'm looking forward to club activities in the future.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
how is your practice?
It's pretty tight. I can barely keep up.
It may be so at first, but you have to do your best.
What about girls?
I'm a special practice, so I don't really understand...
I see. (Gargantua is a special practice huh.)
I hope we can have a special practice together.
That's it, not yet.
So do your best.
Yes, thank you.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
How's your practice going?
It's pretty tight. I can barely keep up.
It may be so at first, but you'll get used to it.
Is that so? What about girls?
I'm a special practice, so I don't really understand.
I see. (Gargantua is a special practice huh.)
We have to be able to do special practice together.
That's it, not yet.
With that in mind, do your best.
Yes, thank you.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
How's your practice going?
It's pretty tight. I can barely keep up.
think so at first. For now, do your best.
Thank you. I'll try my best.
Well then, I'm a special practice, so this is it.
good luck. (Gargantua is a special practice huh.)
Ah, Gargantua. The practice was so hard that I was exhausted.
‥‥‥‥‥. Is that normal?
That's right.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
In such a case, I think it's good to start over from the basics. I was too.
From basics... Gargantua has such moments.
I've been in a slump, too.
That's right. But it was helpful. Thank you.
If you have any questions about swimming, feel free to ask me anytime. I'm not good enough, but I'm strong.
sorry. I'm too busy with my practice.
I don't mind. Good luck then.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
In that case, you should start over from the basics. I did too.
That's how Gargantua got out of a slump. It was helpful.
If it's about swimming, I'll be happy to consult with you anytime.
Thank you. I can help you.
That's why we have special practice.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
In that case, it's better to start over from the basics.
From basics... Thank you. It was helpful.
That's why we have special practice.
Ah, Gargantua. Lately, I've been in a slump and not feeling well.
‥‥‥‥‥. How about starting over from the basics?
Is it basic...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
How are you doing?
For now, I think I'm improving, but...
Compared to when I joined, I've improved a lot.
I guess so.
It would be nice if we could go to the inter-school together...
I don't have the ability yet, but I'll do my best to be able to go.
yes. Good luck. I'm rooting for you.
Thank you. If you get Gargantua's support, you'll have 100 strength.
Well, it's not like that. I will always cooperate with you, so tell me.
Gargantua also has a special practice, but it's bad.
If that's the case, it will work out, so don't hold back. Well then.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
how are you?
For now, I think I'm improving, but...
Compared to when I started, I've improved a lot.
I guess so.
I want to go to Inter-High with you.
I don't have the ability yet, but I'll do my best to be able to go.
I will cooperate with you as much as possible, so do your best.
Gargantua also has a special practice, but it's bad.
Then it will work out, so you don't have to hold back.
Thank you. Gargantua.
I don't mind. Well then.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
how are you?
For now, I think I'm improving, but...
Compared to when I started, I've improved a lot.
I guess so.
I hope I can go to the Inter-High.
I don't have the ability yet, but I'll do my best to be able to go.
That's what I mean. keep it up.
Thank you. Gargantua.
Well then.
Ah, Gargantua. I think I'm improving, but...
‥‥‥‥‥. I have to participate in the Inter-High.
Is it inter-high?
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Let's do a special exercise together.
I was surprised. I can't believe I can be a member of the special practice.
You already have considerable ability, so you should be confident.
Thank you. It's like a dream to be able to practice with Gargantua.
Ah, me too...
What did you say?
Hey, hey, I'm aiming to be number one in Japan at the Inter-High, so I have to get back to practice.
I agree. Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
We have a special practice together.
I was surprised. I can't believe I can be a member of the special practice.
I've been evaluated as having that much ability, so I have to work hard so as not to betray their expectations.
Gargantua has always struggled with this kind of pressure.
that's right. This is the hardest.
Gargantua I respect you. As expected, it's amazing.
When it comes to practice, I don't have time to think about such things.
Are you that strict?
It's already hard. I finally made friends. Let's do our best.
I feel like a sacrifice.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
We have a special practice together.
I was surprised. I can't believe I can be a member of the special practice.
You already have considerable ability, so let's do our best with confidence.
Thank you. It's like a dream to be able to practice with Gargantua.
See, if you don't go to practice, you can't become the best in Japan.
I agree. Let's do our best together.
Ah, Gargantua. Don't you think you've improved recently?
‥‥‥‥‥. After going to Inter-High, what should I say?
All right, I'll do my best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
I heard you're trying to cross the Strait of Dover.
Huh? Well, I'd like to try it.
It's a hoax. I was thinking of going too...
If you're with Gargantua, you can think about it.
For real? Let's go together then.
Well, that's fine, but we'll be number one in Japan together with Gargantua first.
Yeah, that's right. I have to do my best so that I won't lose too.
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Are you trying to cross the Strait of Dover?
Huh? Well, I'd like to try it.
What a good thing. I thought I was getting ahead of myself.
Rather than that, I want to be the best in Japan with Gargantua.
I agree. I have to do my best so that I won't lose too.
Let's do our best together.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Are you trying to cross the Strait of Dover?
Huh? Well, I'd like to try it.

First of all, I'll think about it when I achieve my goal of becoming the best in Japan.
That's right. Do your best.
each other.
Are you going to cross the Strait of Dover?
Exactly where did that story come from...
Hmm. Is it a hoax after all?
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
sorry. I think I put in the wrong ingredients by mistake...
Gargantua made this morning's meal...
really sorry. forgive me please….
No more practice today. But it hurts...
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua seems to have recovered.
Today's practice is very hard... I feel dizzy for some reason...
no more. It is useless.
oh what happened to me...
All right?
is someone calling me
Ah, I think you've noticed.
I've been practicing... I don't remember.
You seem unwell. I fell during practice. I was surprised.
Ah, you took care of me. Thank you…. Eth….
This is Saki Nijino, the manager. Remember.
Thank you Gargantua. I'm Frederique.
It's good to practice hard, but when you're not feeling well, don't overdo it.
sorry. I'm bothering you.
okay, don't worry about it. If you've noticed, you'll be fine.
yeah, okay. that's enough.
Then rest here for a while.
Thank you.
Gargantua? I didn't know that girl was a manager. I have lost so far. But future club activities will be even more fun.
Ah, Pantagruelle.

Practice is hard. I can barely keep up.
You have what it takes to do your best. Never give up.
Thank you. I'll try my best.

Don't think about it, why don't you try a little change of pace?

Phew…. The training camp is over today.
 Shaa……
Hmm! ? It looks like someone's in the bath
lucky! Peep! Quincy No, let's stop.
 (Which one would you like?)
Peek through the left window. Peeking through the window in the middle of Quincy. Look through the window on the right of Quincy.
Lucky, I'm glad I'm alive.
-Girls! Peep!
Bashan
Oops. I was so happy that I cried out.
Ah, my heart is cleansed.
-Girls! ! Someone is watching!
terrible! Run away!
Phew, it looks like you managed to escape. (I think I saw your face...)
Gyojeee~!
+Man, do you want to come in too?
Eh, I'll refrain from doing that.
Haha, I had a terrible time
What this? Bad taste. Maybe Ijuin? I don't know what rich people do.
Well, I'm not the kind of guy to do that.
Phew, I'm a little confused about what I did.
Uu, should I drink my tears and endure it?
Somehow, I feel a surge of power in my body.
Oh oh oh oh! ! ! !
Alouette Secret
Mezzanine
mastered.
Oooooh, I'm hungry...
Everyone in the club is down. Is this food poisoning?
Hmm. We're all going to die because of your grace.
At this rate, I won't die...
Hmm. sorry. Don't go out disguised.
It's dangerous, so don't swing the knife around. I really feel like I'm going to die.
The next day, everyone miraculously made a complete recovery in one day.
Let's resume practice. Gargantua seems to have recovered.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
hello.
Practice is hard. I can barely keep up.
No problem. Because it's graceful, because it can be done.
uh, right?
Yumi is rooting for you, so please do your best.
Thank you. I'll try my best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Practice is hard. I can barely keep up.
Yumi also had a hard time at first, but now she's fine.

I'm sure you'll be fine. Good luck with your practice.
Thank you. I'll try my best.
Ah, Pantagruelle.

I'm glad I entered the science department, but what should I study first?
First of all, I have to learn how to handle the equipment properly.

I think it would be good to have a theme and do your own research...

One more step, and it looks like it's going to be successful.
Then the Nobel Peace Prize is no longer a dream.
There is no way a high school student can win such an award.
If I succeed, I don't think so.

Oh, it's a phone. that's unusual….
Gacha
Yes, Pantagruelle.
Ah, Yoshio. Are you free now?
What is it, Yoshio? Ah, I'm free.
Well then, come to the amusement park now.
Why do I have to go to an amusement park with you?
Well, that's fine. Because I'm waiting
Gacha
What a pushy guy. I can't help it. Shall I go?
Ha... I'm finally here. Come on, let's go inside.
Oh, you're finally here.
Yoshio, why don't you call me to this place... that? Gargantua to Shiori.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could come? thank you
Let's ride the big Ferris wheel.
Which girl are you riding with?

After school. I have a bad feeling.
Don
Oh sorry...
I don't care...
Ah, I won't be on time for the promised time.
What the hell is this?! Are you a new hitter?
I have a feeling someone is looking for me.
I was looking for it.
What is it, Yoshio? What do you want?
don't know what the madness is... I brought a girl who wants to talk to you.
Dude, it's not madness. If you're a normal girl, it's a natural act, isn't it?
You know, even if I regret it later, I don't know.
regret…. What is it?
Hey, we talked. Then I'll go back to my classroom.
hello. I'm Yuko Asahina. Huh..., where...?
Oh, you are a hit!
Excuse me for being a hit shop. It wasn't on purpose, I was in a bit of a hurry...
Hurry up... Apart from that, it's fine... So what do you want for me?
heard from Yoshio-kun that you know that you have a lot of fun, right?
Well, if I say I know, I know..., if I say I don't know, I don't know.
Hmm. Next time, take me somewhere.
Eh, I! What is it?
Hey, isn't it good? Please, take me somewhere.
Hey, don't sound weird! everyone is watching
If you don't promise me, I'll start crying.
I understand, I understand, so just stop it.
really! Super lucky. Absolutely.
yes yes... I'll call you next time...
It's a promise. Well, I'm waiting for your call.
Huh. tired….
It's a promise. I have to call you soon.
But I don't know her phone number. What should I do….
I'll ask Yoshio later...
This kind of problem is trivial. Phew... I'm a genius.
Garat
Who is in the classroom these days? Huh, you have some kind of strange machine.
You are Frederique.
Oh, yes. You are….
Hold on, don't move! There will be errors!
‥‥‥‥. What the hell...
Noisy. The results will come out in a little while, so shut up a little.
‥‥‥‥.
Beep
I got results. Hmm. Not so-so.
Well, who are you?
I'm Yuina Himoo. Someday your brain will be mine.
Huh?
Then let's meet again. Hehehe….

This kind of problem is trivial. Phew... I'm a genius.
Garat

Boom, picopico...
What should I do…. ‥‥‥‥. All right, let's take a peek.
you! ! You've seen something you shouldn't have seen.
Eh, I'm nothing...
There are things in this world that humans shouldn't see.
So I see nothing...
You've seen Recognize? Mr. Frederique.
You didn't see anything! By the way, why do you know my name! ?
No, you saw Already, you are me, Yuina Himio's servant.
I'm a servant...
You are already a member of the science club to which I belong. I won't say no.
You are already a member of the cyber club that I belong to. I won't say no.
No……. (What's wrong, my mouth... my mouth doesn't move.)
Hehehe…. I have already changed the data.
Data is... What kind of data?
Disobedience is not allowed. If you disobey, you will only die. Then let's meet again.

What was that?
….
…Could it be that you were made to join the science club?
….
…Could it be that you were made to join the cyber club?
This kind of problem is trivial. Phew... I'm a genius.
Ugh... (Who is it from behind.... Consciousness is fading...)
Ha, this is the laboratory! Or my body doesn't move...
Oh, Frederique.
 You seem to have woken up.
Who the hell are you! ? What are you going to do with me! ?
It's okay, it doesn't hurt Stay still.
What are you doing! ? Stop it! !
All right. Don't raise your voice! nothing I can do about it….
Please move quickly! !
If you get tired of your body, talk to Yuna Himio. I'll be waiting for you anytime.
Ugh... (Again, my consciousness fades...)
Ha, yu, a dream... Was good…. Hmm, there's a scribble in my notebook. Any requests for remodeling should be directed to Yuna Himio of the Science Club...
Ha, yu, a dream... Was good…. Hmm, there's a scribble in my notebook. Any orders for remodeling can be sent to the Cyber Club and Yuna Himio...
So, what kind of experiment should we do today?
Hey, Patricia. Help me with my experiment.

It's Yuina Himoo. Come quickly! !
Yes.
Oh oh wow!
Ohhhh!
Gyaaaaaaa!
Ha, ha, ha.
You're in good shape, aren't you? Well then, I'll ask you again.
‥‥‥‥. No more! !
Um, what do you mean by ice cream?
It's called an in-circuit emulator, and it's a device for testing the target you're developing in real time under conditions close to the actual environment.
Thank you. Well….
String Yuna. At least remember the names of people in the same club when you join.
I'm sorry... Mr. Himo.
That's why I don't understand such elementary things.
Is that rudimentary?
Study harder. Excuse me then.
Haa... a tight woman.
Pictures are soothing. (Kuh, numb lines.)
Beautiful, nice picture.
Thank you.
Oh, you're from the art club... Who is it?
It's Frederique. You are also from the art club... uhm, who is that?
Ahahahaha... Ayako Katagiri. Oh that's funny...
Well, how was club activities?
That's the line over here. Why don't you draw in the art room?
What do you say... I'm an artist, so I don't like crowds.
Then why did you join the art club?
What do you say... I'm an artist and I love contradictions.
Ahahahaha... There is no such artist.
After all……. I just wanted to paint outside.
Oh, I'm in tears. Let's talk in the art room next time.
A funny guy who laughs right away...
Since you're so good at it, you should join the art club...
It's good for your health to draw once in a while.
Heh... Painting once in a while is good for your health.
That's right, stimulating the pressure points in my hand, like this... No.
Ahahahaha... My name is Ayako Katagiri. you…?
Oh, I'm Frederique.
If you feel like it, come visit the art room. I welcome you.
Oh, if you feel like it.
See you then.
funny guy...
I also like painting, I draw sometimes.
Hey, show me next time.
No way. When I show my paintings to people, they start to move.
When I catch it with a rope... Am I Ikkyu?
 Ahahahaha... I am Ayako Katagiri. you?
Oh, I'm Frederique.
I'll think about painting. Let's talk about painting again. Well then.
Ah, I ran away. Ayako Katagiri, you can't underestimate her.
Pictures are soothing. (Kuh, numb lines.)
Beautiful, nice picture.
oh thank you... (Um, who is this girl? Remember, remember. Marseille!)
 what happened? I'm stunned.
mosquito,…. (No, use your intuition.)
Mr. Katagiri?
that's right. what happened. I must have forgotten...
No, that's not true. (Okay, I got it right. It was just a self-introduction when I joined the club. I totally forgot.)
Even so, you draw nice pictures.
I am honored to be honored. Katagiri-san, don't you draw?
my painting is a secret
No under 18's.
Yes, down to the smallest detail... Why do I draw like that? You'll find out soon.
It's cunning, you want to run away.
Someday, someday... Then I'll go home.
Hey, did you escape...?
Peace of mind is found in music. (Kuh, numb lines.)
Marvelous, nice performance.
oh thank you... (Um, who is this girl? Remember, remember. Marseille!)
 what happened? I'm stunned.
mosquito,…. (No, use your intuition.)
Mr. Katagiri?
that's right. what happened. I must have forgotten...
No, that's not true. (Okay, I got it right. It was just a self-introduction when I joined the club. I totally forgot.)
Even so, it was a wonderful performance today.
I am honored to be honored. The Gargantua clarinet also sounds great.
I think so. Ahahahaha...
‥‥‥‥.
Now let me hear you play it personally. Then I'll go home
‥‥‥‥.
Hey, Yoshio... Anything interesting lately?
That's right... Oh, it's dangerous.
Kyaa.
It's good.
Are you okay?
I'm not okay. Please wake up early.

The handkerchief is falling.
e…. Thank you. When did it fall?
Huh…. I read it with great interest.
You see, I'm the type to get absorbed in what I like. Hahaha...

Huh, that's right.

Kisaragi Mio-san? It was pretty cute.
Oh reading is fun. What a study person I am.

It's a difficult book. After all, whose forgotten item is it?

Didn't the book fall around here?
Oh, you mean this?

You're reading a very difficult book, aren't you?
I'm sorry... It was a very important book. My name is Mio Kisaragi.
I'm Frederique.
Pantagruelle. I'm really thankful to you.
No, you're welcome. I want to talk to you again.
Please come here. Ah, I have to go now.
Kisaragi Mio-san? It was pretty cute.

Pantagruelle.

My name is Mio Kisaragi. A while ago, there was a discussion about the announcement of the school festival...
That's what I was talking about today.
So, together with me, we decided to make a research presentation, so please continue to support us.
Huh, that's right. nice to meet you too.
So you'll excuse me.
Kisaragi Mio-san? (I'm lucky to be doing joint research with such a cute girl.)
Reading for club activities... Hmm, what a man I am.
Um... Pantagruelle...
yes…. Well, you... Gargantua, right?
Yes, it is…. Um... this book is very interesting, so if you don't mind...
Thank you. But... it's a difficult book.
Ufufu…. That's not true. I am sure you will be impressed.
Is it okay if I borrow it for a while?
Any time is fine. Well then, excuse me.
Kisaragi-san, you've been quiet and inconspicuous until now, but you're pretty cute...
I'm super lucky to be able to talk to you.
>Director Yes, go around there! No, no, try again.
Dosun
Oh, it's hard! someone fell down (That's Gargantua)
>Director, it's okay, it looks like you have mild anemia.
>Mr. Pantagruelle, I'm sorry, but please take a look here.
Such forceful...
>Leader, practice practice.
Oh, they're all gone
But Kisaragi-san is pretty cute... Is this useful?
No….
Oh, did you notice?
You took care of me. Thank you very much.
Oh, don't worry about that. (I was made to do it by the director...)
Pantagruelle…. You are so kind...
That's not true! I, then, I'll go back to practice...
I will rest a little more and then go.
Kisaragi Mio-san? How come you know my name?
I don't think you care about me... ………….
It's the same department, so it's natural. I only know her name...
Ah, I'm tired today too.
Ah..., abuna...
yeah?
Boca
is it OK?
Stay….
that…. Are you injured?
Oh, somehow, I feel like I'm alive.
I'm sorry. But you seem fine.
It's not okay As an apology, could you tell me your name?
Ufufu…. My name is Koshiki Yukari. What's your name?
I'm Frederique.
Well then, I'll be back at the club soon, so please excuse me.
The ball hurt, but I got to know Gargantua, okay?

Are you running now too?
Oh yeah. do you too?
I have never missed a 50km roadwork every morning.
Well, every morning, 50 kilometers! Are you... from Kirameki High School?

Yes, I'm Frederique. Kiyokawa is... Um, Mr. Kiyokawa from the swimming club?
that's right, but…. Huh... You know me
You know, you're super famous, aren't you?
She's a super high school level female swimmer. I thought she was more of a rugged girl, but...
Super famous... More than that, let's run together next time.
Hahaha... I hope I don't become a hindrance to Mr. Kiyokawa.
Hahahaha, you can't. Then I will run one more time.
I'm going to rest for a while.
I'll give you this juice because it's left over. Well then.
…. Gungungu…. Phuhah.
Ah, this is not an indirect kiss. lucky.
Good morning, Kiyokawa-san. (She is a super high school level female swimmer.)
Oh, I'm pretty sure it's the swimming club...
It's Frederique. Kiyokawa-san, are you training so early?
I have never missed a 50km roadwork every morning.
Well, every morning, 50 kilometers! are you running that much?
In order to keep the record, I have to do this much...
see…. Being number one in Japan is tough.
yes…. More than that, let's run together next time.
All right, I got a good record today.
Huh... You do a lot
Oh, thank you, Gargantua. (She is a member of the school's swimming team and even holds the Japanese record.)
Um, did you say your name?
It's terrible. It's Frederique.
Oh bad bad But you started swimming after entering high school, right?
Yes, I started in earnest after entering high school.
If you can make a record like this, you might be able to become a big player in the future?
Hahaha, don't tease me. When Mr. Kiyokawa tells me, I'll take it seriously.
I'm not kidding you. Ah, it's my turn to swim. That's golden egg.
Or a golden egg... I'll try my best, swimming...
Phew. Is it finally time to rest?
Mr. Pantagruelle.
Yes. Um, are you...?
Ah, I'm Saki Nijino, the manager of the baseball club.
So, what do you want for me...?
You have guts. Let's aim for Koshien with me!
I'm sorry, but I'm not very interested in baseball.
yes…. If you come, we'll have a lot of strength...
I'm sorry, but I bought too much.
Not at all! But... I can't force myself.
If you feel like it, may I go see it sometime?
Yeah I'm waiting! Well then.
Hey, isn't that the current Saki Nijino?
Oh, it seems so.
What did the athletic club idol want for you?
It's like an invitation to club activities.

If you have any information, please let me know.
Take me somewhere next time.
I agree. I will contact you soon.

Thank you.
Intelligence is oozing out on your face these days.

Nice picture. Show me when you're done.
Thank you.
Oh? You're painting. good luck.

This time, it's something like this. Good luck next time.
Thank you.
It makes no sense for you to do that. Stop wasting your efforts.
Even if you do that, there's no way you can impress a girl.
Ordinary people want to waste their efforts.
Useless things... Do your best.
I'm sure you're trying, but it's all in vain. This is why the common people...
Unrequited efforts...
Common people are sad things. I don't think you have to make that kind of effort.
No matter how hard you try, you will never be able to beat me.

Next time, I'll surprise Himio-san.
Everyone will be fine with this...
I'm the only one special I'm glad.
Ha... I don't feel well today...
‥‥‥‥.
I don't want to do it anymore.
‥‥‥‥.
Don't go out of your way to say that...
Ah, exams are over! !

I want my brother to learn from me.

Good luck with your practice.
Thank you.
Today's play was cool.
Thank you.
Thus ended the cultural festival.
Well nice. There are many poems on it.
Hi, Gargantua. Did you hit your head too?
Noisy. Even though I pretended that people were impressed...
'Cause Gargantua said a line I couldn't think of.
You insulted me I can't.
No, hey, that's what I mean...
Poetry is boring, but I don't want to read it... Give me that collection of poems.
I'm handing it out, so it's fine, but...
I'll let you know what I think tomorrow. Look forward to it.
Gargantua reading poetry...
There's nothing but rubbish here.
Ah, Gargantua. It's rude to say it's rubbish.
Poetry is fantastic, unreal, and silly.
People who enjoy poetry are evidence of a rich heart.
When I have the world in my hands, I'll erase poetry from this world.
Gargantua. Just once, why don't you read this collection of poems?
Is that a challenge for me? All right, I'll take it.
What a challenge...
Excuse me. Look forward to tomorrow and wait.
I said something selfish and left. But what's the fun?
why are you here
Ah, Gargantua. Because I'm in the literary club...
And what to say is... You wrote these silly letters too, right?
Rubbish letters? Oh, it's about poetry. that's right.
don't understand people who write poetry. Are you crazy?
People who enjoy poetry are evidence of a rich heart.
When I have the world in my hands, I'll erase poetry from this world.
Gargantua. Just once, why don't you read this collection of poems?
Is that a challenge for me? All right, I'll take it.
What a challenge...
Excuse me. Look forward to tomorrow and wait.
I said something selfish and left.
It's rubbish.
Gargantua, suddenly it won't.
What's wrong with calling a silly thing a silly thing?
Tell me if it's silly or not after reading this collection of poems.
OK. I'll take the challenge. Look forward to tomorrow.
I said something selfish and left. But what's the fun?
Well nice. It has a lot of composition on it.
Hi, Gargantua. Did you hit your head too?
Noisy. Even though I pretended that people were impressed...
'Cause Gargantua said a line I couldn't think of.
You insulted me I can't.
No, hey, that's what I mean...
Writing is boring I don't want to read it, but... give me that collection of essays.
I'm handing it out, so it's fine, but...
I'll let you know what I think tomorrow. Look forward to it.
Gargantua reading the composition...
It's full of silly sentences.
Ah, Gargantua. It's rude to say silly sentences.
By the way, what is this article about?
It's an essay we wrote.
Composition? It makes me laugh I'm not an elementary school student...
Please read this anthology once, whether it's silly or not.
Is that a challenge for me? All right, I'll take it.
What a challenge...
Excuse me. Look forward to tomorrow and wait.
I said something selfish and left. But what's the fun?
why are you here
Ah, Gargantua. Because I'm in the literary club...

I don't understand people who write essays. Isn't it crazy?

OK. I'll take the challenge. Look forward to tomorrow.
I said something selfish and left. But what's the fun?
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. how was it?
The content was boring, but I'll make you think about the text of my speech.
Gargantua is...? what speech?
When the time comes, we'll know. Excuse me then.
At that time, on earth...?
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. how was it?
It's boring to give a speech in such a small place.
eh? What are you talking about?
When I give a speech, I jack all the TV lines...
that…. What do you think of my argument?
Ah, in order to do that, I have to make a machine that automatically turns on the TV...
that….
Once you've made up your mind, start researching right away.
that…. Thoughts on the argument...
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came How was it?
You said something stupid.
It's terrible to say it's rubbish.
If you have time like that, please come and see the results of my research at the science department.
If you have time like that, come see the results of my research at the Cyber Club.
Gargantua used to be a science club...
Gargantua used to be a cyber club...
What are the results of your research?
Didn't you know before? I fell too...
So, what are the results of your research?
It is inconceivable to those who are content with arguing.
What is it?
think about it for the rest of your life. Excuse me then.
I can't see the exhibition anymore. What the hell were you researching...?
Ah, Gargantua. What the hell are you doing in a place like that?
no, i found it.
found? what?
Anything will do. Goodbye.
what were you doing
If you have time like that, why don't you do some useful research?
What is profitable?
think for yourself Excuse me then.
I guess I didn't like the argument...
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
I didn't agree with the content, but it's not so bad.
How far are you unconvinced?
Good and bad.
That's the theory...
Such an unrealistic thing, There's no way it's possible. You'll find out soon enough.
eh? You'll know soon...?
At that time, you can give it to your theater company. hehehehe….
Your theater company...?
Think about it. Excuse me then.
what are you talking about...
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
Why is the evil magistrate killed? Isn't it funny?
Why... This is the theory of period dramas...
Justice is not always strong in this world. I know now, but...
How come you know now?
I know now. hehehehe…. Goodbye then.
What are you going to do?
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
It's boring. I can't forgive good and bad.
But it's a historical drama theory...
Are you going to excuse me? If I were the ruler, I'd burn this.
Um... not an excuse...
Unpleasant, sorry.
What's wrong with encouraging good and punishing evil...
Ah, Gargantua. What the hell are you doing in a place like that?
no, i found it.
found? what?
Anything will do. Goodbye.
what were you doing
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
It's not funny at all.
Say it clearly.
I can't forgive a hero who pretends to be righteous. I see the world sweetly.
So what do you want?
Well, it would be nice to have a genius beautiful girl rule the world.
You mean Gargantua?
Anything is fine. As a suggestion...
One idea...
I apologize for being a little uncomfortable.
A beautiful genius girl.
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
It wasn't very funny.
Let me be clear.
Because a hypocrite hero who pretends to be righteous is the worst.
Is it hypocrisy to help the weak and crush the evil?
You can't trust people who say things like love and friendship are the power of righteousness.
I wonder...?
Think about it. In the end, heroes will be defeated by force.
That's right, but...
Wherever you end up, power is justice.
but….
You don't have to face justice until you lie. Evil is the best.
‥‥‥‥.
It's a little unpleasant, so I apologize.
I wonder if evil is good...
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
hate this kind of thing.
Normally, girls don't watch hero stuff.
No, I hate righteous heroes.
Huh?
While talking about love and friendship, in the end, power will solve the problem.
Well, that's right.
In that case, I'd rather have an evil organization that says power is justice from the beginning.
I wonder...?
It's not obvious. Think about it properly. Goodbye.
I wonder...?
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
Again, this made me realize again how stupid love is.
So Gargantua doesn't want a boyfriend or something?
Well, it's a trifle before the big plan.
It's too lonely...
It's okay. Someday it will be my way.
Someday...
It's unpleasant. impoliteness.
Gargantua, you look upset.
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
It stinks.
Even if I don't say it clearly...
It's love, it's love, don't make fun of the audience.
Say that far?
After all, love is dwarfed by power.
Gargantua has no romance.
You can't rule the world with romance.
Well, yes, but...
study a little more Goodbye.
My heart is amazing...
I was watching
Ah, Gargantua. You came to see me. how was it?
It's rubbish. This kind of drama should stop.
Eh, it's a masterpiece, but why?
If you're going to do this, come to the science department and see the results of my research.
If you're going to do something like this, come see the results of my research at the Cyber Club.
Gargantua was in the science department.
Gargantua was a cyber club.
What are the results of your research?
Didn't you know before? I fell too...
So, what are the results of your research?
It's unthinkable for someone who's content with theater.
What is it?
think about it for the rest of your life. Excuse me then.
I can't see the exhibition anymore. What the hell were you researching...?
If you have time like that, why don't you do some useful research?
What is profitable?
think for yourself Excuse me then.
Even though it's a masterpiece...
Start the experimental show early.
Start the experimental show early.
Start the experimental show early.
Start early...
How's the machine I built?
How's the machine I built?
How's the machine I built?
Start early...
Ah, Gargantua. What about the cyber department?
Besides, it doesn't matter. Start early.
Ah, Gargantua. What about the cyber department?
Other than that, it won't matter. Start early.
Ah, Gargantua. What about the cyber department?
Separately…. Start early.
Ah, Gargantua. What about the cyber department?
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥. Start early...
Oh, I'll start right away
I'll start right away.
Ah, Gargantua. I'll do it from now on, so check it out with your own eyes.
OK. Try it.
Ah, Gargantua. I'll do it from now on, so check it out with your own eyes.
OK. Try it.
Ah, Gargantua. I'll do it from now on, so check it out with your own eyes.
OK. Try it.
Ah, Gargantua. Gargantua's machine is in good shape.
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥. Start early...
I'll start right away.
how was it?
After all, this is the extent of childishness...
I guess so, I think it's normal...
But don't worry. When that machine is completed, you don't have to do such a boring thing anymore.
Hey, what is that machine?
It's still a secret. But I think I'll be able to show it before I graduate.
Huh, what is it?
Look forward to it. Goodbye then.
If it's a strange machine, I don't like it.
how was it?
It's boring. I wonder why the level is so low.
I think it's normal...
I have to do this. I can't believe my school is at this level...
that….
In a little while, that will be completed. That's right...
Gargantua. What is that...?
I have to go home and finish it as soon as possible.
What is that?
how was it?
Just as I thought. Only monkeys do experiments like this these days.
I don't think monkeys do experiments...
But you are very lucky. in the same grade as me.
Eh, why?
You'll know that by the time you graduate. Excuse me then.
What is it?
Oh, no Gargantua. I was there during the show...
how was it?
Why would you use a laser like this, even though it's a great laser?
No, I think it's beautiful. What about other uses...?
Increase output and use it as a weapon...
Weapons. later?
‥‥‥‥. I don't mind. That's enough.
I wonder...?
But don't worry. When that machine is completed, you don't have to do such a boring thing anymore.
Hey, what is that machine?
It's still a secret. But I think I'll be able to show it before I graduate.
Huh, what is it?
Look forward to it. Goodbye then.
If it's a strange machine, I don't like it.
It's boring. I can't believe that lasers can only be used for this kind of thing...
Eh, not pretty.
I have to do this. I can't believe my school is at this level...
that….
Just a little longer, just a little longer. Completion of that is imminent. that way….
Gargantua. What is that...?
I have to go home and finish it as soon as possible.
What is that?
how was it?
Just as I thought. Only monkeys do experiments like this these days.
I don't think monkeys use lasers...
But you are very lucky. in the same grade as me.
Eh, why?
You'll know that by the time you graduate. Excuse me then.
What is it?
Oh, no Gargantua. I was there during the show...
how was it?
This is science. How did you respect me?
Ah, respect.
That's fine. Excuse me then.
I wonder if Gargantua is a genius after all...
how was it?
Great. I'm scared of my talent.
What kind of theory is this? Just for reference, let me know.
It's a trade secret. Now I'm one step closer to my ambition.
Um, Gargantua... No, I'm completely in my own world.
All humans bow down to me. Fufufufufu….
I wonder if Gargantua is a genius after all...
how was it?
Amazing, just perfect. Ah, my talent is frightening.
That's right... (I think talent isn't the only thing that's scary...)
I'm satisfied. Goodbye then.
I wonder if Gargantua is a genius after all...
Oh, no Gargantua. I was there during the show...
I'm doing something silly...
Ah, Gargantua. It's terrible to be silly. I made it with all my might.
Computer fortune-telling is too stupid.
Not good. Let's do computer fortune-telling, shall we?
I can't help it. I can do it for you.
For real? I'll try to say it.
I'm doing something silly...
Ah, Gargantua. It's terrible to be silly. I made it with all my might.
I can't believe I can only use my computer in such a way...
Not good. Let's do computer fortune-telling, shall we?
If you really want it, you can do it.
For real? I'll try to say it.
I'm doing something silly...
Ah, Gargantua. It's terrible to be silly. I made it with all my might.
Only monkeys do computer fortune-telling, right?
Not good. Let's do computer fortune-telling, shall we?
I don't want to do something stupid like that.
Can't you do it?
No way. Goodbye then.
I wonder if we're incompatible... Yes, let's guess.
‥‥‥‥.
Ah, Gargantua. Do you want to do computer fortune-telling?
no. Excuse me then.
I wonder if we're incompatible... Yes, let's guess.
Oops, my hand slipped.
Ah, the reset button... It's terrible.
By chance, by chance.
Coincidence...
Well, it's like this.
It's a normal result.
Oops, my hand slipped.
Ah, the reset button... It's terrible.
By chance, by chance.
Coincidence...
How come I get these results?
That's probably because Gargantua and I have good chemistry.
There is no such thing. Isn't it a bug?
Well, I can't say no, but...
Well, it's like this.
It's a normal result.
You're right. That's pretty cool.
Eh, no, that's not the case...
What's the best match? Not bad at all.
What, it's not that bad, is it?
As expected, I wonder if it is.
Fortune-telling is boring after all.
Well then, what's good? .
We'll have a satisfying program soon. You'll know then.
Is it a secret until then?
that's right. Goodbye then.
what kind of program is that?
Do you enjoy making things like this?
Well, that's about it...
It's nice, I'm satisfied with this level. I envy you.
So what would Gargantua be able to satisfy?
We'll have a satisfying program soon. You'll know then.
Is it a secret until then?
that's right. Goodbye then.
what kind of program is that?
I'm doing something stupid.
If you say it's rubbish, it's rubbish, but...
Just give it a try.
eh?
let me see
Oh, oh, that's fine
what? This crap...
It's a computer game, but... Why don't you try it?
I wouldn't do it.
That's no surprise.
If you just want to see it, you can take a look at it.
Huh, really? Still, that's fine.
I'm doing something stupid.
I won't say it's silly, but... Look at it for now.
If it's just a little bit, that's fine. let me see
Oh, okay
The game is so weak...
Ah, Gargantua. Hey, why don't you try it?
no.
I'm gone... It's frustrating, so let's play a game.
How is it going?
Well, it's not good for an ordinary person.
For real? I'm happy to hear that from Gargantua.
I'm happy to be satisfied with that degree.
uh, right?
Alas, geniuses are tough. Goodbye then.
Say it yourself….
How is it going?
Well, if you're an ordinary person, that's about it.
So what does Gargantua make?
Well, if it's a game, it's more dangerous and thrilling.
For example?
It would be nice to have a game that takes over any computer using a communication line.
Eh, what is that...
Ah, I'm looking forward to it. I wonder if it will be completed soon. Goodbye then.
Completion... I wonder if it's a game...
How is it going?
After all, it's rubbish.
So what was it like?
It's impossible to explain to ordinary people. Only I can understand. Excuse me then.
What do you think would be good...?
Ahh, that was fun... (Empty….)
dummy
What about my sample version of the program?
It's working fine, but... This is a crime...
Don't worry. Like I said, I'm fine.
Oh yeah. That's fine.
Just give it a try.
Oh, okay
What about my sample version of the program?
It's working fine, but...
Just give it a try.
This is a crime...
okay, let's get started.
Yes.
What about my sample version of the program?
It's working fine, but... This is a crime...
Now... Just give it a try.
now? It's still a crime.
Noisy. shut up and do it
Yes.
Start early...
Ah, Gargantua. A program made by Gargantua...
All right, start early.
I'll start right away.
If I get caught by the police, it's Gargantua's fault.
wow, that's great. I'm one step closer to my ambition.
What is ambition?
It's finished, so we'll find out soon. hehehehe….
Gargantua. I'm scared.
wow, that's great. How amazing I am...
I think it's a crime after all...
Don't let it get out. Besides, it won't be a crime any time soon.
Eh, why?
Because that's what I decide
‥‥‥‥. What does that mean?
It's finished, so we'll find out soon. hehehehe….
Gargantua. I'm scared.
If I get caught by the police, it's Gargantua's fault.
All right. It's not a program that can be exposed.
uh, right?
Besides, it won't be a crime any time soon.
What does that mean?
It's finished, so we'll find out soon. hehehehe….
Oh, no Gargantua. I was there during the show...
what are you doing?
Ah, Gargantua. If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
Well, it would be nice to have a picture of my youth for my autobiography.
autobiography…?
Noisy. Please draw quickly.
・ ・ ・
Yes. copper?
Pretty good. I'd like to ask you for a portrait as well.
Portrait…? of Gargantua?
that's right. I will have you draw it soon.
It's fine, but... when is it?
I'll know when the time comes. n/a…. Goodbye then.
What is that time?
What is this face? I can't feel a shred of intelligence.
I'm sorry, I'm not good at it...
Unpleasant, sorry.
Even if you don't get angry...
what are you doing?
Ah, Gargantua. If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
Well, it's nice to have a picture of yourself in your younger days.
・ ・ ・
Yes. copper?
Not quite. You can give it to your painter.
Your painter...? What that?
Nothing. It's about this. Goodbye then.
It's nice that the painter you have works for a king.
What is this face? I can't feel a shred of intelligence.
I'm sorry, I'm not good at it...
Unpleasant, sorry.
Even if you don't get angry...
what are you doing?
Ah, Gargantua. If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
I don't think you're good enough for the role, but for now, try drawing it.
・ ・ ・
Yes. copper?
So-so. Be more diligent in order to be recognized by me.
Get recognized by Gargantua? why?
A time will come when you'll be glad that you've been recognized by me.
I wonder...?
I don't mind. If you regret it then... Excuse me then.
No regrets...
What is this face? I can't feel a shred of intelligence.
I'm sorry, I'm not good at it...
Unpleasant, sorry.
Even if you don't get angry...
‥‥‥‥.
Ah, Gargantua. If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
Call the person who is the best at drawing.
I'm sorry, but I'm the only one here right now.
That's fine. impoliteness.
‥‥‥‥. What's wrong with my painting?
what are you doing?
Ah, Gargantua. come on
My brain is rotting because I'm only looking at things like this.
Eh, you mean the nude drawing? Only today is special.
Ahh, my brain is about to rot too. Excuse me now.
what are you doing?
Ah, Gargantua. come on
My brain is rotting because I'm only looking at things like this.
Eh, you mean the nude drawing? Only today is special.
If you're looking at something like this, practice my portrait.
Why did I have a portrait of Gargantua...
Ahh, my brain is about to rot too. Excuse me now.
what are you doing?
Ah, Gargantua. come on
My brain is rotting because I'm only looking at things like this.
Eh, you mean the nude drawing? Only today is special.
The more people like this, the easier it will be for me to plan.
Eh, plan? what is that.
Ahh, my brain is about to rot too. Excuse me now.
‥‥‥‥.
Ah, Gargantua. come on
Hmm.
Oh, what a surprise, I didn't expect Gargantua to come.
It's decorated with something.
Ah, Gargantua. It's an oil painting made by an art club member.
yes…. which picture did you draw?
It's the picture over there.
Pretty good. If you try a little harder, you'll pass the line.
What is the passing line?
I'll announce it soon, so please wait a little bit. Goodbye then.
What kind of announcement is this?
It's decorated with something.
Ah, Gargantua. It's an oil painting made by an art club member.
yes…. Not good enough to hang in my palace.
Palace? What is a palace?
Anything will do. It's a secret.
Yes, it's a secret...
Yes, it's a secret.
But if you're going to hang it in that kind of place, wouldn't it be better to use a more famous painter?
I'm not interested in the paintings of people who have succeeded in painting.
Is that so?
The new ruler's castle deserves a painting by a new painter...
Gargantua. What are you mumbling about?
You too, Be more devoted. Goodbye then.
Devoted...
It's decorated with something.
Ah, Gargantua. It's an oil painting made by an art club member.
Not good. I don't like it all.
yes…. It looks like you didn't find a picture you liked.
If you're going to exhibit something like this, come see the results of my research at the science department.
What are the results of your research?
If you want to exhibit something like this, come see the results of my research at the Cyber Club.
What are the results of your research?
If you're going to exhibit something like this, come see the results of my research at the science department.
Gargantua was in the science department.
Didn't you know before? I fell too...
So, what are the results of your research?
If you want to exhibit something like this, come see the results of my research at the Cyber Club.
Gargantua was a cyber club.
Didn't you know before? I fell too...
So, what are the results of your research?
It is unthinkable for people who are satisfied with paintings of this level.
What is it?
think about it for the rest of your life. Excuse me then.
I can't see the exhibition anymore. What the hell were you researching...?
If you have time like that, why don't you do some useful research?
What is profitable?
think for yourself Excuse me then.
I think it's a good picture, but...
What's this?
Ah, Gargantua. It's an oil painting made by an art club member.
I can't bring myself to look at it. impoliteness.
What are you here for...?
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
Well, it's pretty good, isn't it?
I never thought I'd hear such words from Gargantua...
If you do your best at this rate, you'll be able to join the court orchestra.
Court orchestra...?
You'll find out soon. Goodbye then.
I wonder what I'll find out soon...
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
Not so-so.
did you like it? Actually, this is a game song.
Any song is fine.
oh yeah...
Work harder so that you can join the court orchestra.
Court orchestra...?
You'll find out soon. Goodbye then.
I wonder what I'll find out soon...
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's normal.
oh yeah... Actually, this is a game song.
Besides, any song is fine.
oh yeah...
I can't seem to get into the court orchestra.
Court orchestra...?
You'll find out soon. Goodbye then.
I wonder what I'll find out soon...
Ah, Gargantua. What the hell are you doing in a place like that?
no, i found it.
found? what?
Anything will do. Goodbye.
what were you doing
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's boring.
Yes, let me be clear.
I only listen to songs that encourage brain activation.
It's true, this song might make your brain rot...
If you understand, don't ever play this song in front of me again...
Eh, what if I play...?
n/a…. That's it, look forward to it. Excuse me then.
What the hell are you going to do?
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's boring.
Yes, let me be clear.
Don't play this song My brain is rotting.
Do you hate this song that much?
hate it. Only monkeys like this song.
Monkey...
I'll miss you this time. Next time I play... Excuse me then.
What are you going to do next time you play?
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's boring at all.
Yes, let me be clear.
Playing this kind of brain-destroying music makes me more and more stupid.
It's true, this song might make your brain rot, but...
Never play this song in front of me again... Excuse me then.
I wonder what will happen when I play...?
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
Well, it's pretty good, isn't it?
eh…? (Gargantua would say such a thing...)
Oh, I had an epiphany. It's nice to have a brainwashing strategy with music.
Eh, what is that?
A good performance sparks a good idea.
A good idea is the brainwashing of today...
Did you hear me? Because it's you, I'll give you special forgiveness.
Thank you.
But if you talk to someone... Do you understand?
yes, i understand... Talking is outrageous... I won't do that.
That's fine. Excuse me then.
I was scared. What happens when you talk...
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
Not good….
eh…? (Gargantua would say such a thing...)
Oh, I had an epiphany. It's nice to have a brainwashing strategy with music.
Eh, what is that?
A good performance sparks a good idea.
A good idea is the brainwashing of today...
If you talk more than that, I won't guarantee your life.
Yes... Talking is outrageous... I won't do that.
That's fine. Excuse me then.
I was scared. If you talk, you'll really get killed...
I was listening.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
Well…. Ah, this song seems to spark something.
what?
Noisy. Just shut up...
Yes...
It's been a while... If I go back to the lab, it might come out.
‥‥‥‥. (Do you still have an epiphany?)
Then go back to the lab. impoliteness.
What was it that inspired you?
And so, this year's exhibition is over.
Thus ended the cultural festival.
Why do I have to do this?
Are you talking about public drug testing?
I hate these boring experiments. And to show it to others.
The future ruler should not worry about such small things.
uh, right? I don't want to do it, but you can do it.
I'm tired. But if you flatter yourself, you'll be able to do something about it.
Why do I have to do this?
Are you talking about public drug testing?
Such a boring thing, you should do it.
No, for a stage like this, someone as great as Himio-sama would suit you.
I wonder if that's right? It can't be helped, I'll do it.
I'm tired. But if you flatter yourself, you'll be able to do something about it.
Why do I have to do this?
Are you talking about public drug testing?
that's right. I refuse to do such a boring experiment.
Don't say that. Please. Dr. Himo.
Doctor? I like that sound. You can do it.
I'm tired. But if you flatter yourself, you'll be able to do something about it.
I had to get involved in such a silly experiment...
Excuse me. Gargantua.
I don't want to talk to a dumb, ignorant monkey.
Oh, this laser... It's different from the one I made the other day.
What did you make the other day?
Look, the guy who cut through a 50-centimeter-thick iron plate.
‥‥‥‥. (Did you make such a dangerous thing?)
Without that, it lacks power.
It's not a matter of power or anything like that.
Well, okay. I will forgive you this time.
What happened. Not like Gargantua.
Next year, I'll show you my scientific prowess. Fufufufufu….
Oh, this laser... It's different from the one I made the other day.
What did you make the other day?
Look, the guy who cut through a 50-centimeter-thick iron plate.
Such a dangerous thing can't be used, can it?
Oh, be safe. Besides, without that, it lacks power.
safety?
It's fine as long as you don't get close within a 3km radius.
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥. I wouldn't say it's safe, but...
Well, okay. I will forgive you this time.
yeah? What happened. Not like Gargantua.
Next year, I'll show you my scientific prowess. Ufufu….
Oh, this laser... It's different from the one I made the other day.
What did you make the other day?
Look, the guy who cut through a 50-centimeter-thick iron plate.
Such a dangerous thing can't be used, can it?
This is why I don't like amateurs. But okay. I will forgive you this time.
yeah? What happened. Not like Gargantua.
Next year, I'll show you my scientific prowess. Fufufufufu….
Oh, this laser... who prepared?
What's the matter, Gargantua? I prepared it.
Also, an ignorant monkey prepared it.
‥‥‥‥.
wonder if I'll use it as an experiment material next time.
The time has come to show you my true scientific prowess.
Hey, are you sure you're okay? This machine...
Who are you talking to? Just shut up and watch.
Yes, let me see.
Fufufufu, it's finally time to show off my scientific prowess.
Hey, are you sure you're okay? This machine...
Who are you talking to? I'm a super genius
that…. If you don't mind, can you tell me the theory?
Now we can finally openly conduct human experiments.
Um, the theory...
Let's get started.
Fufufufu, it's finally time to show off my scientific prowess.
Hey, are you sure you're okay? This machine...
Who are you talking to? I'm a super genius
that…. If you don't mind, can you tell me the theory?
no. think for yourself
Fufufufu, it's finally time to show off my scientific prowess.
Hey, are you sure you're okay? This machine...
There's an annoying little bug... Shall we make it the first human experimentation?
No…. no thanks.
If that's the case, please don't interrupt me.
It was boring.
Thank you for your hard work. Mr. Himo.
Next year, I won't do it again.
It was boring.
Thank you for your hard work. Mr. Himo.
Next year, I won't do it again.
It was boring.
Thank you for your hard work. Dr. Himo.
Next year, I won't do it again.
stupid. It was boring.
Thank you for your hard work.
Please don't talk to the monkey.
After all, it would be boring if it wasn't that laser.
uh, right?
Ah, I can't wait for next year.
After all, it would be boring if it wasn't that laser.
uh, right?
Ah, I can't wait for next year.
After all, it would be boring if it wasn't that laser.
uh, right?
Ah, I can't wait for next year.
It was boring at all.
uh, right?
See you next year. I'll show you my scientific prowess.
Well, I don't have the word "failure". I'm scared of my talent.
It was amazing. (I think talent isn't the only thing that's scary...)
did you respect me
Oh respected.
yes. Well then.
I did it, I succeeded. Now I'm one step closer to my ambition.
Um... Gargantua... No, you're completely in your own world.
Fufufufufu...
I did it, I succeeded. Now I'm one step closer to my ambition.
Um... Gargantua... No, you're completely in your own world.
Fufufufufu...
I did it, I succeeded. Now I'm one step closer to my ambition.
Um... Gargantua... No, you're completely in your own world.
Fufufufufu...
It was boring.
It looks like something exploded. were you okay?
It's all right, isn't it? Everything is calculated.
That's right. (Liar….)
It was boring.
It looks like something exploded. were you okay?
It's all right, isn't it? Everything is calculated.
That's right. (Liar….)
It was boring.
It looks like something exploded. were you okay?
It's all right, isn't it? Everything is calculated.
That's right. (Liar….)
It was boring and I just made it explode.
were you okay?
Don't be stupid. I'm different from you.
Fortune telling is stupid. have you made it?
From the blood type, I can predict the compatibility of two people, but...
I'll check it out for you.
ok, apart from that...
Don't complain, lend me your computer.
yes yes Please check.
You should enter your data here.
Fortune telling is stupid. have you made it?
From the blood type, I can predict the compatibility of two people, but...
Hmm, right.
Hey Gargantua. Can you help me with the final check?
I don't want to help you with such a silly thing.
can't help it.
Fortune-telling is silly.
Um... Gargantua.
‥‥‥‥. What?
It's a compatibility fortune-telling, but if you'd like, can you check it out?
no.
can't help it.
Oops, my hand slipped.
Ah, the reset button... It's terrible.
By chance, by chance.
Coincidence...
Well, it's like this.
It's a normal result.
Oops, my hand slipped.
Ah, the reset button... It's terrible.
By chance, by chance.
Coincidence...
How come I get these results?
That's probably because Gargantua and I have good chemistry.
There is no such thing. Isn't it a bug?
Well, I can't say no, but...
Well, it's like this.
It's a normal result.
You're right. That's pretty cool.
Eh, no, that's not the case...
Hey, it's the perfect match. Not bad at all.
Hey, it's not that bad, is it?
As expected, I wonder if it is.
Do you enjoy making things like this?
Well, that's about it...
It's nice, I'm envious of being satisfied with this level.
guess so...
Ahh…. Computer fortune-telling is silly.
Didn't you make Gargantua?
I made it anyway. It's titled "Super Future Class Fortune-telling".
Something looks amazing... What kind of divination?
Answer the questions within the time limit and predict the future. Why don't you give it a try?
OK, let's try...
Then let's get started.
・ ・ ・
You know...
What.
Isn't this an intelligence test?
Well, I would say yes.
‥‥‥. What does that have to do with the future...?
I don't understand. If you pass this test, you can become my subordinate, the ruling class in the future.
‥‥‥‥. Ha, is that so?
This is more reliable than fortune-telling that doesn't make sense.
I don't care about games. have you made it?
I made it, but... I don't have a lot of confidence.
yes? It's okay if I rate it.
It really helps.
Then play it.
Huh? Isn't Gargantua playing?
It's noisy, please shut up.
yes yes
It's silly, but it's pretty good.
Oh yeah. When Gargantua says that, it gives me confidence.
Games are really silly, aren't they?
I don't care about games. have you made it?
I made it, but... I don't have a lot of confidence.
yes.
Ah, Gargantua.
What?
I'm sorry, but I don't appreciate it.
Really bad. It's fine if you just watch.
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥. That's fine.
It's silly, but it's okay.
Oh yeah. When Gargantua says that, it gives me confidence.
Games are really silly, aren't they?
Games are stupid.
Ah, Gargantua.
…What?
I'm sorry, but I don't appreciate it.
I hate it
Do you want to play alone and lonely?
Computer games are silly.
 Did Gargantua hate games?
I don't hate it, but it's just a boring game.
Isn't it just a game?
For example, this Yuna-sama game I made is amazing.
That's a great name... how awesome
You know, when you play games, you come to worship me.
That's just brainwashing...
It's fun. copper? Why don't you try it too?
No. I will refrain from...
Oh, that's too bad.
Enduring the unbearable, enduring the unbearable, and finally this day has come.
Gargantua. What are you excited about?
Be, separately…. I'm not excited.
But today's demonstration. You don't actually break into computers, do you?
Well, what do you think?
Military satellite programs have multiple layers of protection, right?
If you just shut up and watch, you'll understand.
Enduring the unbearable, enduring the unbearable, and finally this day has come.
Gargantua. What are you excited about?
Be, separately…. I'm not excited.
But today's demonstration. You don't actually break in, do you?
I wouldn't tell someone like you.
Military satellite programs have multiple layers of protection, right?
If you just shut up and watch, you'll understand.
Enduring the unbearable, enduring the unbearable, and finally this day has come.
Gargantua. I wonder if today's demonstration is aimed at winning.
Hmm. I don't deal with people like you.
saw? my genius program.
Gargantua…. What are you...
hehehehe…. The world will soon be mine
saw? my genius program.
Gargantua…. What are you...
hehehehe…. The world will soon be mine
I did it Soon everything will be mine...
Gargantua…. What are you...
Oh that was fun. (Empty….)
‥‥‥‥.
Pantagruelle. say hello to me
Eh, oh. Good morning, Gargantua.
Be sure to come to the science department. order.
Be sure to come to the cyber department. order.
Yes, I will definitely go. QuincyEh, what should I do?
Of course. If you don't come, you know. Quincy, remember.
Well then, it's an appointment with Gargantua, so I think I'll go to the science club.
Well then, it's an appointment with Gargantua, so I guess I'll go to the cyber club.
‥‥‥.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
What's wrong?
Why don't we visit together?
I'm from the science department. You think you can do a tour?
I'm the cyber club. You think you can do a tour?
Oh, I see. It can't be helped.
Well, it's selfish for you to come to visit.
Well, it's selfish for you to come to visit.
do you go alone
Oh, Pantagruelle.
Why don't we visit together?
I'm in the science department. There's no way we can go together.
I'm in the cyber club. There's no way we can go together.
Oh, I see. It can't be helped.
Well, it's selfish for you to come to visit.
I didn't know you were in that department...
Oh, Pantagruelle.
What do you want from me?
Why don't we visit together?
I'm from the science department. You think you can do a tour?
I'm the cyber club. You think you can do a tour?
Oh, I see. It can't be helped.
Well, originally, I'm not interested in school festivals.
do you go alone
 ‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥.
Um... Gargantua. Would you like to visit with me?
Excuse me, I'm in the science department. There's no way I can go.
Noisy, I'm in the cyber club. There's no way I can go.
‥‥‥‥. do you go alone
Thus ended the cultural festival.
Oh, you're here.
You're here.
You came.
Gargantua was this club.
What are you exhibiting here?
It's a show of silly chemical compounding experiments.
Heh, when does that start?
I'll start now, but it's silly.

Heh, when does that start?
I'll start now, but you don't have to watch it.
Gargantua is missing. I'll see you at the show.
You were able to watch it all the way to the end.
It looks like it exploded at the end, but were you okay?
Of course. Don't call it an explosion like that.
Oh yeah. I hope you're okay.
I don't have anything else to do, so you can go home.
That's right. Shall we go home soon?
If you come every year, I'll show you something good soon.
Were you still?
It looks like it exploded at the end, but were you okay?
explosion? I don't know Isn't it a mistake to burn it?
B, that's fine, though. Did you get hurt?
I don't think so. I don't know if it's an explosion.
That's fine. Come on, let's go home soon.
If you come every year, I'll show you something good soon.
Were you still?
It looks like it exploded at the end, but were you okay?
It is natural. If you don't do that, it's boring.
Oh yeah. That's fine.
If you don't have anything to do, why don't you go home already?
That's right. Shall we go home soon?
That's good.
It exploded, but I wonder if he's okay.
What are you exhibiting here?
Draw a silly picture with a silly laser beam.

You were able to watch it all the way to the end.
It was so beautiful.
I don't care about that sort of thing. With my laser...
With a Gargantua laser?
I could cut through a 50 cm thick steel plate.
That has nothing to do with this experiment...
Ah, I'm frustrated.
Come on, let's go home soon.
next year. See you next year.
Were you still?
It was so beautiful.
what?
What the hell is this show...
Why?
Why...
I can't believe you can only use your laser for such a ridiculous thing.
oh yeah... Come on, let's go home soon.
next year. See you next year.
Were you still?
It's so beautiful.
Because there are people like this, I can only do stupid things all the time.
‥‥‥‥. Come on, let's go home soon.
next year. See you next year.
It was quite beautiful.
What are you exhibiting here?
Demonstration of matter transfer experiment.
Buh, material transfer? When does that start?
I'll start now, so please take your time.

What do you think of this research?
That's amazing. It was like I was dreaming.
don't you. Ah, I'm afraid of my talent.
That's right... (I think talent isn't the only thing that's scary...)
Now my dream will come true.
dream? (Gargantua is pretty cute, too.)
It's a secret now. I'll find out soon.
Oh yeah. Well then, I'll be home soon.
Goodbye.
What about this machine? would be great.
That's amazing. It was like I was dreaming.
I think you've realized my scientific abilities.
Oh, I figured it out. But what do you use this for?
With this, my ambition is as good as accomplished. Fufufufufu...
Don't listen to me. I'm kind of scared... Let's go home now.
Fufufufufu…. Oh wait.
How's my science?
That's amazing. It was like I was dreaming.
don't you. Now everything is as I expected.
‥‥‥‥. Come on, let's go home soon.
Goodbye. Enjoy the freedom of the moment.
very. It was like I was dreaming.

‥‥‥‥. What is this result?
That's what it is. Nothing else.
I wouldn't call this a fortune-telling...
It's okay. It's better to be certain than something like that, isn't it?
I don't think this is a certainty, but...
I know now that it is certain.
Oh yeah. Well then, I'll be home soon.
If you come every year, I'll show you something good soon.

Oh yeah. Well then, I'll be home soon.
Goodbye.
Hmm, good result.
Is it like this?
It's terrible.
What are you exhibiting here?

Gargantua is missing. Oh, I have a game. let's try it.
It's not very clever. You can make me a battle captain.
what is that?
It's a secret now. You'll find out soon.
I'm not good at it.
Quite difficult.
yes? Combat is more difficult.

Even if it's clever like this, it won't do anything.
That's true, but... Shall we go home soon?

how about this program?
That's amazing. what happened now?
Just a little bit, I borrowed a certain A country's military satellite and attacked it with a laser.
Is it okay to do that?
All right. My dream will come true soon.
dream? (Gargantua is pretty cute, too.)
It's a secret now. I'll find out soon.
Oh yeah. Well then, I'll be home soon.

Oh wait. My story isn't over yet.

Do you want to duet with me?
Why did you stop in the middle?

Pantagruelle. I want to hear a song
Can you tell me too?
It's a shame because it was a very good song.
It's a difficult song.
It's a difficult song.
Pantagruelle. I want to hear you sing.
You're good at it.
I wanted to ask you a little more, but I'm sorry.
Oh? Is it over already?
Oh? Is it over already?
Can you sing me a song?
It's pretty good.
It's a pity to stop in the middle.

Hi, while I'm looking for a song, could you sing it first?
Oh, um, that was good.
I'm sorry. I haven't decided which song to sing yet.
I'm sorry. I haven't decided which song to sing yet.
I'm sorry. I haven't decided which song to sing yet.
Pantagruelle. Can I hear you sing?
Good... how long have you practiced?
what happened. Are you feeling unwell?
Ufufufu…. I don't have the guts to stop in the middle of the day.
Halfway is not good.
Sing gracefully, let me hear it.
Yumi is also practicing this song.
Ah, continue, let me sing gracefully.

Thus ended the cultural festival.
Well then, excuse me soon.
Yeah. Are you ready to go?
If I don't go, there will be many people who will be sad.
Well then, excuse me soon.
Yeah. Are you ready to go?
Of course. I'm not a woman who stays in one place.
Well then, excuse me soon.
Yeah. Are you ready to go?
If you keep me here forever, the boys won't be silent.
Well then, excuse me soon.
Yeah. Are you ready to go?
I just happened to be there. It's not like I had anything else to do with you.
I came to play with you.
Was good. I just had some free time.
Oh this poem... Did you write it for me?
Maybe so.
Isn't this your poem?
No.
What is it?
This is a collection of poems that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
Yes, I will.
I came to play with you.
Was good. I just had some free time.
Is there a poem that praises my beauty?
I wonder if there is
If you're from this school, you'll want to write poems like that.
This is a collection of poems that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
It's in this. I'll have it then.
I don't think so...
Ah, Gargantua. You came
I didn't come here for you.
This is a collection of poems that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
It's not a very happy present, but I'll keep it for now.
I don't mean to make a tribute, but...
Oh, no.
Gargantua. You came
Wrong, I apologize.
This is a collection of poems that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
No, thank you. I just got it.
yes….
I came to play with you.
Was good. I just had some free time.
What is this many sentences?
Written by all members It's a composition.
Composition...? Sounds nostalgic...
This is an anthology that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
Yes, I will.

Composition...? Something sounds nostalgic...
This is an anthology that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
I don't really want it, but... I'll take it for now.
I'm sure it will be interesting.
Ah, Gargantua. You came
I didn't come here for you.
This is an anthology that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?

Gargantua. You came
Wrong, I apologize.
This is a collection of poems that our club made this time. If you don't mind, why don't you read it?
No, thank you. I just got it.
yes….
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I didn't really understand it, but it wasn't good.
If you don't understand well, I still have a long way to go with my arguments.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I didn't listen well, but it wasn't good.
Please listen carefully. I argued with all my might.
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
haven't listened to it much, so I don't know.
I worked hard, so please listen to me.
Oh, no.
Gargantua. You came
I wonder why you came to a place like this.
Ah, wait Gargantua.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I don't like period dramas, but they were good.
Thank you. But period dramas are also interesting.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I don't like period dramas. I liked the other one.
I think period dramas are interesting too.
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
don't really like period dramas, so I hardly watched them.
I worked hard, so please watch me.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It was like a kid, but it wasn't good.
Thank you. But even if you're a kid, funny things are funny.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I'll do something weird. Is it funny to be this kind of kid?
That's prejudice. I think it's pretty interesting...
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
It looks like a kid and I hardly ever see it.
I worked hard, so please watch me.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I think that kind of love is delusional, but I was a little moved.
Thank you. That's what a masterpiece is.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
That kind of love is nice, but I haven't found a man who suits me yet.
‥‥‥‥‥. I hope you show up soon.
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
Such love is an illusion. Love isn't something you receive unilaterally from a man, is it?
Isn't that lonely?
I came to play with you.
It was just right. It's an experimental show. Go see
Well…. All right, I'll take a look.
I came to play with you.
It was just right. It's an experimental show. Go see
I don't have much time, but... okay, I'll take a look.
Ah, Gargantua. You came
By the way, I didn't come here for you.
It's an experimental show. Go see it.
I don't have a lot of time, but... it can't be helped, I'll take a look.
Oh, no.
It was just right. It's an experimental show. Go see
‥‥‥. I don't want to see it, but I can't help it.
Oh, a few pieces flew by. What are you going to do if you get a scar on your face?
Oh, I'm sorry. I never thought it would explode like that.
OK, I'll forgive you. Well then, excuse me soon.
Yeah. Are you ready to go?
If I don't go, there will be many people who will be sad.
A little bit of debris flew by. What would you do if you got a scar on your face?
Oh, I'm sorry. I never thought it would explode like that.
Nothing happened, so I'll forgive you. I'll excuse myself soon.
Yeah. Are you ready to go?
Of course. I'm not a girl who stays in one place.
A little bit of debris flew.
Oh, I'm sorry. I never thought it would explode like that.
If you get a scar on your face, the other boys will kill you.
‥‥‥‥.
not beautiful. I can't beat it.
‥‥‥‥. Oh yeah. I agree.
It's not pretty. I can't even match my beauty.
‥‥‥‥. Oh yeah. I agree.
It would have looked beautiful without me, but...
‥‥‥‥.
Wha, what now...
Are you surprised? This is matter transfer.
If this is the case, you can prepare more slowly when you go on a date.
‥‥‥‥. (Are there other more useful uses?)
Wha, what now...
Are you surprised? This is matter transfer.
If it's like this, when you're on a date, two people can do it.
‥‥‥‥. (Are there other more useful uses?)
Wha, what now...
Are you surprised? This is matter transfer.
With this, you don't have to use the train when you go on a date.
‥‥‥‥. (Are there other more useful uses?)
Wha, what now...
It's a laser attack from a satellite. I bet you were surprised.
With this, I can pull off men who don't suit me.
‥‥‥‥. (Is that the only thing that comes to mind?)
Wha, what now...

Oh, no Gargantua. I was there during the show...
I came to play with you.
I'm doing computer fortune telling, but how about trying it?
Well…. OK, let's try it.
I came to play with you.
I'm doing computer fortune telling, but how about trying it?
don't have much time, but... okay, I'll do it.
Ah, Gargantua. You came
By the way, I didn't come here for you.
I'm doing computer fortune telling, but how about trying it?
I don't have much time, but... It can't be helped, I'll do it.
Oh, no.
I'm doing computer fortune telling, but how about trying it?
It's fine.
I wonder if we're incompatible... Yes, let's guess.
It was good, wasn't it? would be happy
Well, well.
It was good, wasn't it? Not bad results.
agree.
We are incompatible. It was a pity, wasn't it?
Because fortune-telling is a game. I don't really care.
It was good, wasn't it? would be happy
Well, well.
It was good, wasn't it? Not bad results.
agree.
It was a pity. I would be disappointed.
Because fortune-telling is a game. I don't really care.
It was good, wasn't it? would be happy
Well, well.
It was good, wasn't it? Not bad results.
agree.
It was a pity. Don't get discouraged and commit suicide.
Because fortune-telling is a game. I don't really care.
What's the best match? Not bad at all.
What, it's not that bad, is it?
As expected, I wonder if it is.
I came to play with you.
I made a computer game, how about trying it?
I'm fine Can you give it a try?
I came to play with you.
Ah, Gargantua. I made a computer game, how about trying it?
I don't play games much. It's okay if you just look.
Then look.
Ah, Gargantua. You came
By the way, I didn't come here for you.
I made a computer game, how about trying it?
I don't play games much. It's okay if you just look.
Then look.
Oh, no.
I made a computer game, how about trying it?
It's fine.
I'm gone... It's frustrating, so let's play a game.
Oh, you're surprisingly good at it.
It's because he made it.
Frankly speaking, I'm not good at it.
Because the person who made it is not necessarily good.
Oh, you're surprisingly good at it.
It's because he made it.
Frankly speaking, I'm not good at it.
Because the person who made it is not necessarily good.
Oh, you're surprisingly good at it.
It's because he made it.
Frankly speaking, I'm not good at it.
Because the person who made it is not necessarily good.
Oh that was fun. (Empty….)
Oh that was fun. (Empty….)
I came to play with you.
If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
yeah, that's fine. I'm a model, so please draw me beautiful.
・ ・ ・
Yes. copper?
So-so. But I'm a little more beautiful.
That's right.
Yes. They don't look alike, but I'll forgive you.
oh thank you... (It's surprising that he would forgive me even though I don't look like him.)
I came to play with you.
Ah, Gargantua. If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
Well, it's not bad to leave my beauty as a painting.
・ ・ ・
Yes. copper?
We look alike. I'm beautiful after all.
That's right.
What part of this is me? They don't look alike at all. take a closer look
I'm sorry. Redraw.
・ ・ ・
How about this time?
They don't look alike, but I'll forgive you.
oh thank you... (Ta, that was helpful.)
Ah, Gargantua. You came
By the way, I didn't come here for you.
If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
Well, it's not bad to leave my beauty as a painting.

oh thank you... (Ta, that was helpful.)
Oh, no.
If you don't mind, how about a portrait?
I don't want it.
yes….
I came to play with you.
Ah, Gargantua. come on
Oh, you're drawing something like this.
Or don't get me wrong. This is art, so...
art? I wouldn't call this art.
eh. (Ugh, a sharp point...)
It can only be called art when someone with perfect beauty like me is used as a model.
Well then, can you be my model next time?
Well... it's not that I don't think about it.
Eh, true.
You must be joking. Well then, excuse me.
Oh, what a surprise, I didn't expect Gargantua to come.
I came to play with you.
Ah, Gargantua. come on
Hmm. You're drawing something like this.
Or don't get me wrong. This is art, so...
art? I wouldn't call this art.
eh. (Ugh, a sharp point...)
It can only be called art when someone with perfect beauty like me is used as a model.

Hmm. You're drawing something like this.
Or don't get me wrong. This is art, so...
art? I wouldn't call this art.
eh. (Ugh, a sharp point...)
Learn to understand true beauty.
Oh, what a surprise, I didn't expect Gargantua to come.
Oh, no.
Gargantua. You came
Wrong, I apologize.
Oh, I'm gone What are you here for...?
I came to play with you.
Was good. I just had some free time.
Is there a picture that suits me...?
I don't know. how about this?
Not good. did you draw this?
Ah yes.
Would you like me to draw a picture for you next time?
They liked it so much. Thank you, I'm happy
I came to play with you.
Was good. I just had some free time.
Is there a picture that suits me...?
I don't know. how about this?
Huh, that's pretty good. did you draw this?
Ah yes.
You've finally come to understand beautiful things, haven't you?
mother…. Thank you.
Ah, Gargantua. You came
Is there a picture that suits me...?
I don't know. how about this?
So-so. did you draw this?
Ah yes.
You should try a little harder.
That's right...
Oh, no.
Gargantua. You came
I wonder why you came to a place like this.
Ah, wait Gargantua.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I don't know what song it is, but it was good.
Thank you. Actually, it was a game song...
game? I don't know.
Usually girls don't know many people.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I don't know what song it is, so I didn't listen to it much.
Actually, it was a game song...
game? I wanted the song to be a little more understandable.
yes? But I wanted you to listen to me...
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
I don't know what song it is, so I didn't listen to it at all.
I played hard, so please listen to me for a little while.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's not my favorite song, but it was fun, wasn't it?
Thank you. But you don't like me that much...
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's too comical for me, and it doesn't suit me.
I agree. It doesn't suit you.
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
The song doesn't suit me. I don't really like it.
yes…. I thought it was interesting.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
I think it's good that you're as elegant as I am.
uh, right? Thank you.
You look tired.
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?
It's quite elegant... I'm glad it's suitable for me.
That's right. Thank you.
Oh.
Ah, Gargantua came. how was it?
It was pretty good, but you didn't have the dignity I had.
yes? I wonder if it wasn't good enough.
Oh, no.
Gargantua. You came
I wonder why you came to a place like this.
Ah, wait Gargantua.
Oh, Pantagruelle.
Oh, Gargantua, good morning.
Still alone?
yeah, yeah
It's okay if I go with you. Hohohohoho.
Yes, please. QuincyNo, it's fine.
Well, I can't think of a man who refuses my invitation... Where are you going? Quincy what! I'm the one who took the trouble to invite you. Excuse me.
Yes, I made you angry.
Good morning. Pantagruelle.
Why don't we visit together?
let me see…. By the way, that's fine. I'll go with you.
Where shall we go?
Oh, Pantagruelle.
something?
Why don't we visit together?
Well, you can go with me and give it to me. Hohohohoho.
‥‥‥‥‥. Where shall we go?
Oh, what do you want?
Why don't we visit together?
Well, you can think about it. Hohohohoho.
Well then, let's take a look together.
Please. You can walk with me
‥‥‥‥. Let's take a look together...
Well, that's fine. Well then, can you quickly decide where to go?
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥. What do you want?
Why don't we visit together?
I'm not tired enough to invite you.
Huh, it's terrible... It's too bad...
It can't be helped, should I go alone?
Thus ended the cultural festival.
I toured the exhibits with Gargantua.
I searched the exhibits by myself.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the Literary Club is having an exhibition of poetry.
I'm not really interested in literary things like this.
Well, don't say that. Let's see.
I can't help it. Let's go then.
how was it?
Poetry is good once in a while.
Oh yeah.
Let's go home now.
I agree. go home.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the Literary Club is having an exhibition of poetry.
exhibition of poetry? Is there a poem that praises my beauty?
wonder if it doesn't exist...
Don't tell me anything, just search for it.
eh, me?
It's not obvious. do you want me to do it
Hey, I get it.
found?
What do you think of what's posted here?
read it.
Oh, your eyes shine like stars, your hair is like the flow of clear water...
It's kind of old fashioned.
Even so, I searched hard. No more.
I can't help it. Well, let's get this all right.
Was good.
Well then, I have the next schedule, so I'll go home.
Ah, Gargantua. wait.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the Literary Club is having an exhibition of poetry.
exhibition of poetry? Invite me all the way, that's all?
I don't like it.
Why should I read this stuff?
Why, poetry enriches the heart.
I can't date you. I have my next appointment. Excuse me for that.
Ah, Gargantua. wait.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the Literature Club is exhibiting their compositions.
I'm not really interested in such plain things.
Well, don't say that. Let's see.
I can't help it. Let's go then.
I can't do it anymore If you read any more than this, you won't read it alone.
Well then, I'm fine too. Let's go home.
I know the story. Let's go home.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the Literature Club is exhibiting their compositions.
Writing exhibition? do you see that?
I came all the way here...
If you see something like that, I'm sorry.
Wait a minute, Gargantua.
what? Do you still need anything?
I'm going home too
Hohohohohohoho…. You don't have to come after me.
‥‥‥‥.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the Literature Club is exhibiting their compositions.
Writing exhibition? Are you going to invite me to show you something like that?
I don't like it.
Why should I read this stuff?
W-how do you feel nostalgic for composition?
If you want to read that much, read it in the dark and alone. It suits you.
That's terrible.
I have my next appointment. Then excuse me. Hohohohohoho.
Ah, Gargantua. wait.
Oh, it looks like something is about to start.
It looks like the debate is about to begin.
Oh, it looks like something is about to start.
It looks like the debate is about to begin.
Arguing is boring, isn't it?
I came all the way here. Let's listen.
Oh, it looks like something is about to start.
It looks like the debate is about to begin.
Arguing is boring, isn't it?
I came all the way here. Let's listen.
Hey, what do you think this person was trying to say?
Come on, do something. I'm not very interested in other people's affairs.
Oh yeah. Shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
It was boring after all.
I didn't understand what you were saying.
Taking me out to show you something like this makes me laugh.
Uh, you said that...
I have my next appointment. Excuse me then. Hohohohohoho.
I went to all the trouble to come with you, but it was boring.
Eh, wasn't that fun...?
I was looked down upon too. Did you think this would make me happy?
That's what you said...
I have my next appointment. Then excuse me. Hohohohohoho.
Ah, Gargantua. wait.
Oh, it looks like something is about to start.
It looks like the play is about to start.
Oh, it looks like something is about to start.
It looks like the play is about to start.
Oh, it looks like something is about to start.
It looks like the play is about to start.
Was funny?
I'm not interested in period dramas.
Huh, right? I'm sorry, it looks like we're dating...
I don't mind. Please be careful in the future.
Thank you, Gargantua, you are kind.
What are you talking about... Let's go home soon.
I agree. go home.
what? What is the current play?
What? It's a period drama, but...
It's funny how you take me out and show me something like that.
Uh, you said that...
I have my next appointment. Excuse me then. Hohohohohoho.
I can't believe you invited me to show you something like that.
Oh, don't you like it?
It is natural. You thought I'd be happy with something like that?
That's...
I have my next appointment. Then excuse me. Hohohohohoho.
Was funny?
I'm not interested in that kind of thing, so I didn't watch it.
Oh yeah. I'm sorry.
Yes. Please be careful in the future.
Shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
What's the play now? Don't you think it's rude to me?
Oh, wasn't that fun?
It's not funny. How dare you take me out and show me something like that...
Uh, you said that...
I have my next appointment. Excuse me then. Hohohohohoho.
What's the play now? Is that something that invites me to take a look?
Oh, don't you like it?
I don't think you'll like it. I want you to stop making fun of people.
Oh, what a fool...
If you want me to like you, think about what you should do with that lack of head. Excuse me.
It was really interesting. But I can't have a single-minded love like the one in the play today.
Why?
This beauty of mine prevents my unwavering love. Oh, I curse God
oh yeah... Shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
Well, it was pretty funny.
Oh, good.
But for now, I'm not interested in that kind of single-minded love.
That's right...
I have my next appointment. Excuse me then. Hohohohohoho.
Well, it was pretty funny.
Oh, good.
If you invite me, it's only natural for something like this.
Is that so?
I have my next appointment. Then excuse me. Hohohohohoho.
What are you doing here?
It looks like the science club is about to start an experiment show.
What are you doing here?
It looks like the science club is about to start an experiment show.
What are you doing here?
It looks like the science club is about to start an experiment show.
What is the current experiment? It was dangerous, wasn't it? Excuse me.
What do you mean by bringing me to such a dangerous show?
I didn't think it was such a dangerous experiment.
Luckily, no debris flew into my face, so that was good.
It's a blessing in misfortune.
I can't stay in such a dangerous place. Excuse me then.
What do you mean by bringing me to such a dangerous show?
I didn't think it was such a dangerous experiment.
It would be unbearable if my face was scratched without even thinking about it.
I'm sorry.
I can't stay in such a dangerous place. Excuse me then.
It's not pretty.
You seem to like it.
However, it's a pity that in front of me, it's just a line of light.
Is that so...
curse God for giving me such beauty.
‥‥‥‥. Well then, shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
It's no match for my beauty, but it wasn't beautiful.
That's right. It's no match for Gargantua, though...
It was too obvious, and it wasn't even time to say it. Hohohohohoho.
Shall we go home together?
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment, so please excuse me.
how was it fun
what did you think
I thought it was beautiful, but...
than me?
That's...
It can't be that way. Everything fades before my beauty.
That's right. You are right.
It's fine if you know Excuse me, I have another appointment.
Wha, what happened just now...
That's the material transfer guy right now? It was amazing.
uh, right? Oh, I wouldn't be surprised by that.
I was very surprised.
When you're as beautiful as I am, I wouldn't be surprised at something like that.
I'm not sure, but is that the case?
that's right. come to understand.
As you can see... Shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
Wha, what happened just now...
That's the material transfer guy right now? It was amazing.
Heh, it's convenient. As long as you have this, you can receive a gift without having to meet.
Well, I don't think that's the problem...
what? You said something about my thoughts, didn't you?
No. nothing.
Well then, I have plans for the next one, so excuse me. Hohohohohoho.
Wha, what happened just now...
That's the material transfer guy right now? It was amazing.
Heh, it's convenient. If you have this, you can date many people in a day.
don't think so, but...
what? Is there something wrong with my thinking?
No. nothing.
Well then, I have another plan, so excuse me. Hohohohohoho.
where did you go Gargantua.
Thank you for waiting. Let's go home.
what have you been up to?
I apologized to the current experimenter.
Oh yeah. Well then, let's go home.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the cyber department is doing computer fortune-telling. Hey, let me guess for you.
nothing I can do about it. OK. Even if you do it.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the cyber department is doing computer fortune-telling. Hey, let me guess for you.

This fortune telling is right.
It was good, wasn't it? Not bad results.

It was a pity. I would be disappointed.
I'm sure this fortune-telling won't come true.

agree.
It was a pity. Don't get discouraged and commit suicide.
I'm sure this fortune-telling won't come true.
For me, I don't care about the results of fortune-telling.
Why?
As long as you think of me, compatibility is not a problem.
I agree. But I can't quite convey my thoughts.
Oh, if you really care about me, I can tell by your attitude.
For example...?
Yes, gifts, luggage, etc.
You can do your homework, and there are many other things.
‥‥‥‥. Oh yeah. Shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
Fortune-telling means nothing in front of me.
Why?
How much compatibility with me How much have you done for me? Other than that, nothing.
‥‥‥‥. Oh yeah.
Excuse me, I have another appointment. Hohohohohoho.
You don't have to worry about the results of your fortune-telling.
Why?
After all, compatibility with me is something that I decide. Hohohohohoho.
‥‥‥‥. That's right.
Excuse me, I have another appointment. Hohohohohoho.
What are you doing here?
The cyber department looks like an exhibition of computer games. Why not try Gargantua?
will refrain Something that doesn't suit me.
Well then, can I do it?
nothing I can do about it. Please do as you please.
What are you doing here?
The cyber department looks like an exhibition of computer games. Why not try Gargantua?
why do i I have no interest in this sort of thing.
But I came all the way here...
I'm persistent. I didn't come here because I wanted to.
Look at that. Because I do it
If you will.
What are you doing here?
The cyber department looks like an exhibition of computer games. Why not try Gargantua?
I won't I feel so stupid to do something like this.
But, I came all the way here...
I wonder what your intentions were in bringing me to a place like this?
What do you mean...
It must be fun for me to come to a place like this. Use your head more.
Well then, watch me play.
If you will.
Oh, I'm not very good at it.
It's pretty easy.
Frankly speaking, I'm not good at it.
This is quite difficult.
Let's go home then.
Eh, are you going home already?
Because it's not fun to be in a place like this.
Oh yeah. Let's go home.
It's boring for me to be in a place like this, so please excuse me.

Wha, what happened just now...
You said hacking, so I guess you hijacked some kind of computer.
That's right. It's hacking.
Gargantua, do you know?
Please don't make a fool of me. I know that much. It is natural.
Well, then, do you know what computer they hijacked?
know, but I won't tell you. think for yourself
That's right, Even if you tell me. (I really don't know.)
I don't care about that kind of thing. Come on, let's go home.
yes yes Let's go home.
Wha, what happened just now...
You said hacking, so I guess you hijacked some kind of computer.
What are you talking about? Please explain what just happened.
I'm not sure. I think it's probably a laser attack from a satellite.
Oh yeah. A laser attack from a satellite.
That's right, it's a laser from a satellite. Aren't you surprised?
Why should I be surprised?
Why, even though it's a laser...
It doesn't matter. Because it didn't hit me.
Oh yeah. Shall we go home together?
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment, so please excuse me.
Wha, what happened just now...

Oh yeah. Shall we go home together?
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment, so please excuse me.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the art club will draw a portrait for you. Why don't you draw Gargantua?
Yes. I wonder if I can do it as a service or as a model.
・ ・ ・
how was the caricature?
couldn't draw it.
Eh, why?
Even though I'm the model for him, he can only draw pictures of that level...
So what about that picture?
I made him rewrite it many times, but I'm not a demon either, so I allowed him to write about 50 pages.
oh yeah... It was tough. (A member of the art club...)
After all, my beauty cannot be expressed in pictures.
That's right. Shall we go home soon?
Yes. I don't mind. Let's go home.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the art club will draw a portrait for you. Why don't you draw Gargantua?
Yes. It would be nice to leave this beauty as a painting.
・ ・ ・
how was the caricature?
portrait? There is no such thing.
What's going on?
Expressing me in such a picture is blaspheming beauty.
So...
Of course I ripped it up.
oh yeah...
Well, there can't be anything that can express my beauty.
That's right. Shall we go home soon?
Do you have plans from now? Excuse me then. Hohohohohoho.
What are you doing here?
It seems that the art club will draw a portrait for you. Why don't you draw Gargantua?
Yes. It would be nice to leave this beauty as a picture.
・ ・ ・
how was the caricature?
No way. I have no talent.
What's going on?
It's too dissimilar, so I threw it away on the spot.
Oh yeah.
Well, there can't be anything that can express my beauty.
That's right. Shall we go home soon?
Do you have plans from now? Excuse me then. Hohohohohoho.
here….
What's wrong? Gargantua.
What exactly did you come here to see?
What are you doing? I can't see very well.
I'm not interested in this kind of thing. See it alone. Excuse me then.
Oh oh oh oh What is this?
>Staff, please be quiet. It interferes with my drawing.
Gargantua, wait a minute. I'll be back too
here….
What's wrong? Gargantua.
Did you mean to bring me here and show me something like this?
What are you doing? I can't see very well.
Well, compared to me, it's a million times inferior, but it might be just right for you.
I don't know what you're comparing, but you can't see it.
Oh yeah? Excuse me, why don't you just watch it by yourself?
eh? Why are you leaving?
I don't have time to look at things like this. Excuse me then.
Something like this... oh oh oh. What is this?
>Staff, please be quiet. It interferes with my drawing.
Gargantua, wait a minute. I didn't know you were doing something like this.
here….
What's wrong? Gargantua.
Don't be silly. How did you come to see me like this?
eh? Gargantua what are you mad at?
I don't like seeing things like this. Sorry about that.
Something like this... oh oh oh. What is this?
>Staff, please be quiet. It interferes with my drawing.
Gargantua, wait a minute. I didn't know you were doing something like this.
What are you doing here?
The art club seems to be exhibiting oil paintings.
yes. Do you have a picture that suits me?
Let's look for it slowly.
how was it?
So-so. I can't wait to meet you.
It's an art club picture. Besides, few paintings match the beauty of Gargantua.
Oh, you've gotten better at telling the truth.
That's not true. (Thanks to Gargantua, I've been trained.)
There's no point in staying here as long as I don't have a painting that suits me. Let's go home now.
I agree. Shall we go home?
What are you doing here?
The art club seems to be exhibiting oil paintings.
yes. Do you have a picture that suits me?
Let's look for it slowly.
I don't wanna look Will you come find me?
Why am I...?
Look for it, don't look for it. Which one?
understood. To find.

I was really surprised. Shall we go home soon?
I agree. Let's do so.
I heard something loud.

It was so beautiful. I was dazed.
That's right. (As usual...)
If you don't mind, I'd like to see it again, but...
Oh, okay Let's take another look.
It was beautiful. I almost lost track of time.
That's right. (Did you have a sense of time...)
It was very beautiful, so let's say a few words. That's right...
Hey, Gargantua, take it easy at home...
Is that so. Let's say you're at home.
That's good. Shall we go home soon?
I agree. Let's go home now.

The science club also does magic tricks.
Well then, shall we go home soon?
I agree. Let's go home now.
It was an interesting trick.
That's right. (I think it's a sleight of hand... Don't believe me...)
I can't do that kind of thing.

It's like computer fortune telling. Let's do it together.

Fortune-telling? Well, that's fine.
It's the perfect match.
It's a normal result, neither good nor bad.
It doesn't look so good... See, fortune-telling is a game.
Is that so. That's the result.
Aren't you interested in the results of your fortune telling?
If you worry about the results of fortune-telling, you have to think about unnecessary things.
That's right. Shall we go home soon?
I agree. Let's do so.
‥‥‥‥. That's the result.
Sounds like it. (He doesn't seem very interested.)
A computer can do anything.

Is it a laser beam? It was beautiful.
That's right. Shall we go home soon?

It's amazing that it doesn't move even with laser beams...

As expected, That's right.

It seems that the art club can draw a portrait for you.
Is it a caricature?
Gargantua, why don't you draw it?
I agree. Let me draw it for you.
・ ・ ・
how was the caricature?
Ah, that's right. I went to get a portrait drawn.
What were you doing?
I watched him draw a portrait from behind. You were good at it.

I agree. Let's go home.

agree. Gargantua Did you know that song?
No, I'm always listening to it in a daze, so I don't remember much.
Since it's game music, you probably haven't heard it before?

It's okay, Gargantua. have to believe in yourself
Even if you say that... I already... I think I'm going to fall.
See, even during practice, I was told I was the best.
That's right, but... but somehow, I feel like I can do it well.

Well then, let's go.
Hmm, looks like it worked out.

When you're nervous, think of the audience as pumpkins.

Now it's your turn. I think you should go early.
oh yeah...
It's my first time on stage. My legs are already shaking...
I'm on stage for the first time too. I'm worried whether I will fail or not.
My head is blank and I can't think of anything. What to do now?
It's okay. If you remember to practice, I'm sure you'll do well.
If so, that's fine, but...
Ah, it's time to go. Well then, let's do our best together.

That's right...
No matter how many times I stand on stage, I get really nervous before the start of the performance.
It's okay, you've been doing well so far.
That's right, but... Something is about to fall over...
What are you going to do with that kind of weakness? believe in yourself.
yes. Somehow, I got the feeling that it would work.
Was good. Ah, it's time to go. Well then, let's go.

I'm nervous, but... I've gotten used to being in public.
Even so, this time, I was fired up for practice.
It was my dream. Will you be performing in this production?
Huh, that's right.
And since this is the last year...
If the end is good, what will it be? Let's brace ourselves.

Gargantua, calm down.
Even though I'm in a good mood, I got in the way...
I managed to finish it.
The reception of the audience was also good, I have nothing to say.
Do your best, It's the result of practice I'm sure...
Anyway, I'm glad it ended safely.
I managed to finish it.
I wonder if the reaction of the audience was not so good...

And so, this year's exhibition is over.
Thus ended the cultural festival.
Hi. How are you doing?
Not really good.
Why?
Today's portrait, I'm a little worried...
Don't worry about that.
I do not think so…?
You're talented because I know best...
Thank you. Somehow, I gained confidence.
Oh, then let's do our best together.
Perfect. It was perfect, today's exhibition.
It was a big hit.
All of which were great. Not a natural result.
I wonder why so many people didn't come.
For real. Surprisingly, it didn't come.
Call me. I'm sure I didn't get enough calls.
Don't call me...
Hi. How are you doing?
Not really good.
Why?
Today's portrait, I'm a little worried...
What are you saying that doesn't suit you?
What is it that doesn't suit you?
There's no way you're that sensitive.
Excuse me. Because I'm naive...
Good luck with that. Mr. Delicate. Hahaha.
Even if you don't laugh that much...
It was perfect, it was perfect. today's exhibition.
It was a big hit.
Guys, it's been great, not a given.
I wonder why so many people didn't come.
For real. Surprisingly, it didn't come.
Call me. I'm sure I didn't get enough calls.
Don't call me...
‥‥‥.
Ah, Gargantua. good morning. Can you draw a portrait well?
Excuse me. i don't want to be with you
It was perfect, it was perfect. today's exhibition.
It was a big hit.
‥‥‥‥. I was in a good mood, but...
Oh. Portrait, I wish I was confident.
You didn't come here much. Why?
Listen to your own chest.
‥‥‥‥‥.
It's disgusting. Your eyes are smiling
eh. Uh, isn't Gargantua the one who's happy about that?
Why should I be happy to see a woman naked?
Then why not a naked man?
Yes. If you could take it off
Huh, me?
Hahaha, just kidding, just kidding. Are you serious?
A little bit….
Well then, model girl, don't attack me.
I won't attack
Pantagruelle. It's disgusting. Your eyes are smiling
eh. Uh, isn't Gargantua the one who's happy about that?
Why should I be happy to see a woman naked?
Then why not a naked man?
Yes. can you take it off?
Huh, me?
That's right. It's decided. I want to see you naked
Well then, I want to see Gargantua naked too.
Oh, I'm tall
Eh, do you want money?
It is natural. I can't just show you this body.
So, is my nakedness just?
Well, about 50 yen.
So where are you naked?
Well, just by showing it, I wonder if it's 50,000 yen.
‥‥‥. that's enough.
yes? Well then, model girl, don't attack me.
I won't attack
It's disgusting. Your eyes are smiling
eh. Uh, isn't Gargantua the one who's happy about that?
Why should I be happy to see a woman naked?
Then why not a naked man?
I'm tired of seeing naked women.
Gargantua is disgusting, isn't it?
Wow, I'm speaking from an artistic point of view...
yes, artistic...
I don't believe you.
No, I believe you. (I don't believe it...)
I don't mind. Don't get lustful and attack a model girl.
I won't attack
Disgusting…. To see art with such eyes...
eh. That kind of eyes...
The eyes that are missing in between.
That's right. (Though I was born with these eyes.)
Don't look at us like that. disgusting.
Is the oil painting for the exhibition completed properly?
I completed it, but... I'm not good at oil painting, so I'm a little unsure.
Shall I rate it?
It really helps.

For real? When you say so, I feel relieved.
Also, the person who drew it...

The last explosion was a surprise.
More than that, I was surprised by the people in the science department who were totally fine with that explosion.
It was fine.
Shall we go home soon?
Yeah, let's go home
The explosion at the end was awesome.
But I think the highlight was the explosion.
Not good. Manly.
Manly... Well, whatever. Let's go home soon.
I agree. Let's do so.
I'm not sure, but the last explosion was awesome.
To put it the other way around, that was the only fun part.
That's true too.
Shall we go home soon?
Yeah, let's go home
Beautiful. Was good.
what?
What is it... It's okay, it's not.
It's fine, but... Well then, let's go home soon.
No. Let's go home.
It was beautiful. Now that we're together...
sorry. I'm with you...
Apart from that, I tried to say that I'm glad it was you.
Liar. OK, let's go home.
Hahaha…. yeah let's do it
It must have been wonderful to see it with someone you love.
Well then, It was a wonderful time.
It's not like that.
Even if I don't say it that far...
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

I wonder if I can...
I'm always exercising, so I'm ignorant of things like this...
Let's go home soon. (Even if you don't exercise, you don't know this...)
Yeah, let's go home
It must have been a sleight of hand. It's not going to be like that.
I wonder if it's a trick... I didn't think so, but...
It's an absolute sleight of hand. I've never seen a machine like that.
Maybe so. Well then, let's go home soon.
I agree. Let's do so.
It was amazing. what species is it?
I don't think it's a sleight of hand.
I wonder if that's the case. Let's go home soon.
I agree. go home.

Well, fortune-telling is like this.

I don't believe in fortune-telling...

I... I'm not good at thunder.
I think it's probably a laser beam, not lightning.
Well, that's fine, but...
is it really good?
It's kind of scary, so let's go home.
Right, let's go home. (It's rare to see Gargantua look scared.)

Eh, there's no thunder.
I mean, it's shining now, isn't it?

The art club seems to draw portraits.
Gargantua, why don't you draw it?
Yes, I would like you to draw it for me.

how was the caricature?
After all, caricatures aren't for me, so I stopped.

You knew

It's no use trying to cover it up. Look, let's take a look.
Oh oh oh oh What is this?
saw? this thing
But you don't know, do you?
It's kind of strange... Oh, okay. I'll believe you
uh, right? Thank you. Shall we go home then?
Well, if watching this isn't your purpose, let's go home.
Look sideways again.
Ah.
What's wrong, Gargantua?
Already, I love you.
What?
You don't have to tell everyone I know. Please take your time.
Oh oh oh oh What is this?

Ha, Gargantua, you're misunderstanding. Wait a moment.

It was funny. If you listen to this before the competition, you'll lose your strength and it's useless.
Eh, before the tournament?
Before swimming competitions, I always listen to music for concentration.
Certainly, if you listen to a song like this at such a time, you will lose your strength.
I guess. I can't unify my mind.
Well then, let's go home soon.

So what do you mean?
Um... I thought it was embarrassing to wear such braces...
It means the same thing... That's... because I'm wearing a mask...
Really…. If I wear a mask...
Well, I think it's better not to think about such things too much.
That's right... that…. I'm about to...
that….
Ah, Gargantua. You came how was it?

Gargantua, why don't you draw it?
What should I do…. Yeah, I'll come and have you draw it for me.

What are you talking about? I'm not sure.
I'm embarrassed when I'm with you, so I'm sorry. I will return first.

I told you not to come to such a nasty place.
Haha, that's right.
What, did you want to meet grace?
Well, it's not like that, but...
I'll tell you that you looked lonely without Yumi.
Don't overdo it, you idiot.
It's hard to please Yumi, so let's go. See you.

For that purpose? ‥‥‥‥. See you soon, Gargantua.
Oh wait!
Who should I make a fortune-telling with?
Then it's compatible with Gargantua.
*PC NMS_9000* Tadaima, Keisanchu...
*PC NMS_9000* Oftarino, Aishoha Yoihoudesu.

 hi how are you doing
What is it, Ijuin?
By the looks of it, it looks like you didn't get a single chocolate.
Don't worry, it would be better.
Well, don't be so angry. I thought so, so I brought you one chocolate.
Ijuin, you! Are you making a fool of me
No, no, that's what I mean. I'm sorry, it was bad. I was the morning
eh? Are you sorry now? Are you serious?
what is it? Is it that rare for me to apologize?
Oh well. But if you apologize, I will forgive you.
Right, I'm really sorry.
Huh, Ijuin? You have your hand bandaged. What happened?
Oh, is this it? A little burn... It's nothing to do with you. Then excuse me.
Even so, it was an awfully gorgeous chocolate. It would have been nice if Ijuin was a woman.
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yes chocolate.
Thank you. But it's 10 yen each.
I'm dumb right now sorry.
I don't mind. (No matter where you look at it, it only looks like obligation.)
Ah, Pantagruelle
Yes chocolate.
Thank you. This is chocolate from that famous shop, isn't it?
Huh, do you understand? You're fashion conscious.
It was a good buy.
I've been lining up since 5am.
In order to give it to me, I went out of my way to do that...
After all, if I'm going to give it to you, I have to do this much...
Thank you, I'm happy
Well then, I'm in a hurry...
Somehow, I'm very happy.
got a lot. I'm not amazing
I got a lot. It seems to be quite popular.
Well, if you can get this much, it's good.
I didn't get much, but I wonder if it's like this.
I didn't get one today. I miss you...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Yes chocolate.
Thank you. (You're small, I wonder if this is my obligation...)
Ah, Pantagruelle.
This may be in bad shape, but...
Thank you. I am glad.
At school, I was too embarrassed to hand it over...
Why?
Because... it's a chocolate filled with special feelings...
eh? that's….
Well then, see you again.
Any special thoughts...
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Sorry for earlier. Asked by a friend...
no problem.
This may be in bad shape, but...
Thank you. I am glad.
At school, I was too embarrassed to hand it over...

Sorry for earlier. Yes chocolate.
Thank you. (You're small, I wonder if this is my obligation...)
Pantagruelle. It's chocolate.
Huh, Gargantua to me? I'm glad. Thank you.
Please submit a report about the symptoms you experienced after eating this. Excuse me then.
What's in there?
Ah,
Pantagruelle I made this while I was doing the experiment, so I'll give it to you.
Thank you. I am glad.
I think you'll be fine, but if your limbs get numb, tell me right away.
Why?
I have a little bit of a special feeling...
I'm happy to hear your special thoughts, but...
Excuse me then.
I wonder what's in there...?
Good morning.
What is it, Ijuin?
It's Valentine's Day today. It's no match for you, but I got some too.
I see. It was great.
Look. It's still there.
‥‥‥‥.
I don't think so, but if your bag is empty on your way home, please let me know.
What is it?
I'll give you just a little bit of mine. see you soon. Hah, hahahaha...
‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥‥.
Good morning.
What is it, Ijuin?
It's Valentine's Day today. It happens every year, but I'm totally lost.
I see. It was great.
Look. That's it for this year too...
‥‥‥‥.
I'm having trouble disposing of it. If you don't mind, can you bring me half?
don't need it
You can always tell me if you want see you soon. Hah, hahahahahaha...
Stop it.
Good morning.
Every year, let's go. Gargantua.
You shouldn't be so angry.
It makes me want to get angry. This is every year...
‥‥‥‥.
Well, don't be afraid to give it to me. Hahahahaha….
‥‥‥‥.
That's Gargantua. What yet?
Ah,
Pantagruelle. Yes, it's obligatory chocolate.
Thank you. (Even if you don't say anything clearly...)
Ah,
Pantagruelle Yes, this.
It's chocolate. Thank you. I am glad.
Giri, giri. But it's just a little obligatory.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well then, goodbye.
What is it, I'm so panicked...
Pantagruelle. It's chocolate.
Thank you.
Don't get me wrong. Giri, giri.
I don't mind. (No matter where you look at it, it only looks like obligation.)
Ah, Pantagruelle
It's chocolate.
Thank you.
Valentine's Day is hard. I have to distribute it to many people...
that? This is different from everyone else.
Isn't it okay to do that once in a while?
Am I the only one special?
Isn't it good? I'm busy, so please excuse me.
I think I left in a hurry... (Anything special is good.)
This is chocolate. please.
Thank you. (I wonder if this is a duty...)
Ah, Pantagruelle.
Please take this...
Thank you. I am glad.
Um... inside...
what's inside?
No, no, nothing. and excuse me.
Inside... what is it?
fussy
There's paper inside. Isn't this a poem written by Gargantua? let's see….
Hey, I'm kind of embarrassed...
hello.
Ah, Gargantua. what happened?
It's a boring thing, but if you don't mind, go ahead.
Thank you. (Somehow, I want to go around to say hello. After all, I wonder if it's my obligation...)
Pantagruelle I don't know if this will suit your palate, but if you don't mind, go ahead.
Thank you. But it's a pretty big chocolate.
I was dazed, and before I knew it, I had melted a lot of chocolate...
Is it handmade by Gargantua?
It's a secret until you open it. Please excuse me.
That's it. (Even though I told you it was already melted...)
It's not empty, but yes, chocolate.
Thank you. (I wonder if this is a duty...)
I'm clumsy, so I couldn't do it well, but this...
It's chocolate. Thank you. I am glad.
I'm really not good at it, so don't laugh at it.
That's what I'm working hard I guess you made it. I will never laugh
That's fine. Then definitely eat it.
 yeah yeah I will eat everything.
Even so, Mr. Kiyokawa's Handmade chocolate I'm so happy.
that…. This is for you.
Thank you.
Then... excuse me...
This must be in-law...
that…. This is... that…. Please accept...
Thank you. I am glad. Ah, Gargantua.
It's embarrassing...
You had a red face... I wonder if I was really embarrassed...
Pantagruelle. I want you to come to the back of the school building for a moment.
oh ok
good. Then come over right away.
If it's chocolate, I should have handed it over here, but I'm embarrassed...
Hey. Shiori, here we come.
In a place like this, perhaps, besides chocolate...?
You know, there's a girl I want to introduce you to. Just wait here.
Ha... Isn't it for Shiori... But who is the girl I want to introduce...
But it's embarrassing... After all, it's good...
what are you talking about It's not a great chance. I have to be brave.
I can hear someone talking over there.
that….
yes?
My name is Ai Mikihara. Please take this...
Oh, thank you.
Thankfully…. Oh, I ran away.
I'm sorry, that girl is very shy. Meg, wait a minute!
I'm shy... But it was cute.
Yes chocolate. It's handmade.
Thank you. (But this is the same as everyone else. After all, it's my obligation...)
Ah, Pantagruelle,
This is chocolate.
Thank you. But what happened? You look sleepy.
It took me until morning to make this chocolate...
Until morning? That's a waste and I can't eat it.
But I want you to eat it, so I put my heart into it... Oh, I'm already going.
Ah, Mr. Nijino? It's gone….
By the morning, anyway... Great, I'm so happy.
Pantagruelle, I'm your brother's friend, so I'll give you chocolates.
Thank you. Gargantua.
Ah, Pantagruelle,
This is chocolate.
Thank you. I am glad. Gargantua.
You can get other chocolates, but please don't eat them.

I wonder if I made a promise...
Huh, it looks like there's something on the answering machine. let's hear it
Hello, this is Tatebayashi.
Who is it?
Ha, see you again.
You know, I pretended to be wrong and gave chocolate to my favorite boy.
It doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I wanted it too.

I think it's an unnecessary worry, but it's dangerous to be dazed.
Thank you for your concern. I was fascinated by it.
what were you looking at
Think of it as a big Christmas tree. I watched it all the time.
It's certainly big, but if you look at it from a place like this, you'll run into people.
That's true too. Thank you. What's your name?
I'm not worthy of my name.
It's rude that I don't even know the name of the person who was kind to me.
My name is Frederique. You are?
